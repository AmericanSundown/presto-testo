This is Opera's Presto test repository. After the Presto project was mostly
discontinued, Opera decided to released this repository at the urging of test
enthusiasts involved with the W3C.

These are not production-ready, they need to be checked/fixed for all W3C
requirements before submitting. Some of these may already be submitted. None of
this has been recently checked in any way other than a quick skim for
confidential material. Much of it will be irrelevant for standards, though some
stress tests may be useful, if tangential.

Test suites are gradually uploaded after they've been checked. Specification
testsuites will be worked on first, look in core/standards for the action.

Special thanks to Florian Rivoal for the idea and enthusiasm.
