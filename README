This is Opera's Presto test repository. After the Presto project was mostly
discontinued, Opera decided to release it publicly in its raw form at the
urging of test enthusiasts involved with the W3C.

These are not production-ready, they need to be checked/fixed for all W3C
requirements before submitting. Many of these may already be submitted by James
Graham, Geoffrey Sneddon, or other Opera employees. None of this has been
recently checked in any way other than a quick skim for confidential material.
Some of it may be irrelevant for standards (though some stress tests may be
useful, if tangential).

Test suites are gradually uploaded after they've been checked. Specification
testsuites are done, look in core/standards for those.

Please delete testsuites from this repository when they have been merged into
the appropriate W3C repository.

Special thanks to Florian Rivoal for the idea and enthusiasm.
