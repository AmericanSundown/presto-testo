<h1>Extended cache management</h1>
<p>Edit opera.ini: Add <code>people.opera.com</code> to "trusted domains". </p>
<p>[OEM]<br>
  Never Flush Trusted Servers=people.opera.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Load the <a href="http://people.opera.com/herman/Cachmgmt/"> start page</a>. 
  This is what you do with each link on the test page: </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Click (link on start page) and remember/write the text in the image.
      <li>Empty the cache (in the browser, do not delete the files)
      <li>Click (link on start page) Do <em>not</em> reload, or use the history.
      <li>Adjust the system clock two days forward.
      <li>Click (link on start page) not history and not reload.
      <li>Adjust the system clock back.
    </ol>


    
<h2>Expected results</h2>

    <p>The images have "Expire:" set 24 hours into the future. 
      Adjusting the system clock two days forward will make all the
      images "stale".</p>



    <h3>Without never-flush</h3>

    <h4>Never changing image</h4>

    <p>When revisiting the link after the cache has been flushed,
      the image is the same as last time.</p>

    
<p>When revisiting the link after adjusting the system clock, the image doesn't 
  change. But it should be loaded from server.</p>


    <h4>Always changing image</h4>

    <p>When revisiting the link after the cache has been flushed,
      the image changes.</p>

    <p>When revisiting the link after adjusting the system clock,
      the image changes.</p>
