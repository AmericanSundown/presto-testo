     Framework for running a set of ECMAScript/JavaScript/DOM benchmarks

     Every benchmark should include the script reportresult.js.  The last
     thing the benchmark should do (*following* all calls to document.write, etc,
     and ideally as the last HTML element) is to call reportresult() with the
     name of the benchmark and the time in milliseconds.  The rest is more or
     less magic.  See reportresult.js for further info.

<p><b>Notes and guidelines</b></p>

<p>On a fast (1.8GHz) system with Opera 7 it will take several minutes to
run the benchmark suite.</p>

<p>Benchmarks are sensitive to noise, so for the best results you should
<ol>
<li>Reboot your computer
<li>Start a release build of Opera <em>outside</em> Visual Studio
<li>Load this file
<li>Click 'Start'
</ol>
</p>

<p>In Opera 7 Beta 2, and probably in other versions, there is a bug
that makes timings obtained with autorunning quite different from (worse than)
times obtained by running one and one benchmark.</p>
