<h1>JavaScript security tests</h1>

<h2>Positive security</h2>

<p>Tests that check whether Opera controls access to information from scripts that
are not loaded from the same protocol, domain, and port number as the information
itself.</p>

<a href="otherwindow1.html">Denying access to document in other window, from other domain</a><br />

<a href="boguslink.html">JS console can be injected with a link that contains a payload of trojan JS code that runs in the FILE: domain, allowing it to browse the disk (GrayMagic Opera advisory, unpublished).</a><br>
<a href="boguslink2.html">JS console can be injected with a link that contains a payload of trojan JS code that runs in the FILE: domain, allowing it to browse the disk (Nesumin advisory to securityfocus).  7.10 or later.</a><br>

<h2>Negative security</h2>

<p>Tests that check that important functionality is still available in Opera, that is,
that security is not too tight.</p>
