<p>This test case checks that it is not possible to read the contents
of a frame from another frame using javascript: URLs.  This bug was
reported by Andreas Sandblad to support, subsequently refined by
Hallvord Steen.  We do not have a bug number for it.</p>

<p>When you click on the link below you will be taken to a page with
four frames.  In the rightmost frame there are three buttons.  Click
them; you get a series of alerts.  The first alert, if shown,
describes what will happen (what sniffed info you will see).  If you
see the predicted info you have a problem; otherwise (even when you
see no alerts) you are fine.</p>

<p>(If you do not see content in the iframe, then the test will not
work.  Also, you should load this file from a web server, not from
your local disk, as in the latter case it's OK for the script to
see the directory listing.)</p>
