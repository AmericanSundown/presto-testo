<!-- Test....: Properties on other windows cannot be set or read from other domain
     Requires: HTTP or other domain-based mechanism; does not make sense with FILE.

     Since there was no checking on access of native properties, it
     would be possible to get a handle to an existing window by
     opening it (or by pre-creating it before the victim opens it) and
     then override properties on it.

     This test case tests that it is not possible to change the
     contents of a window object from a nonmatching domain.  We test
     this by opening a window in the same domain, then changing our
     domain and trying to inject a bogus version of 'setInterval' in
     the other window.  If we succeed, our bogus version will be
     called and the alert will reveal that the bug is still there.

     If we do not succeed, the original setInterval will be used in
     the other window, and it will show an alert showing that the
     problem is no longer present.
