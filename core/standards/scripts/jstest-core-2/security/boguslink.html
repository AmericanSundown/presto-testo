<!-- Test: Executable content with FILE: privilege can be injected
       into JS console and can be used to read other content with
       FILE: privilege

     2003-02-06 / lth

     Reported by GrayMagic (no known public advisory)

     Using opera.postError it is possible to post text to the console
     that is interpreted as a URL and therefore is clickable, but also
     executes a payload of trojan code.  This attack takes advantage
     of the specific code in the console and the way quoting of text
     is (not) done.

     The attack requires a user to click on a strange-looking link in
     the console for the payload to be executed; the payload is
     visible in the link, so the user should be suspicious.  However,
     the payload can be concealed in a containing page, so an attack
     is not completely outlandish.

     This page tests whether the quoting is done correctly to avoid
     this attack.

<body>
<p>This page posts three error messages to the JS console.  Click on
each of them in turn; you should see no alert boxes popping up.  (The
third was never a problem but is there to demonstrate that it is not a
problem.  The other two were broken in Opera 7.00 and Opera 7.01 on
Windows.)</p>
