         <em>-SpaceInvaders made with DOM and JavaScript</em>
      </p>
      <h2>ASCII version</h2>
      <p>
         This version uses PRE elements with ascii inside. CSS in an external
         stylesheet is used to describe how they are too look.
         All figures move inside a big table element. 
         <a href="ascii.html">Play!</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Heavy manipulation of a document. The cells in the table are
            constantly changed, many simultaneously. Evertything on screen
            moves by altering the contents of this table.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Image version</h2>
      <p>
         This version uses transparent PNG images inside DIV elements
         for figures. These are moved around by setting their top and
         left CSS properties in pixels. Thus, they can move around
         all the screen that is given the game.
         <a href="image.html">Play!</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            DOM/CSS. The figures are moved through DOM/CSS, changing the
            top and left CSS properties of the different elements. Also,
            setAttribute() is used numerous time to change both
            normal element attributes like id, but also to set/change
            external CSS information, like "class".
         </li>
         <li>
            Heavy rendering. After a few levels, the
            game/document gets extremly heavy to render.
            Very much is going on at the same time, with
            numerous images (20+) moving constantly.
         </li>
         <li>
            Preloading of images, using the Image object, see
            the <a href="scripts/spaceinvaders-image.js">init()</a> method.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Both versions</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>
            DOM/HTML. Almost everything is done through the DOM.
            The only thing which are not DOM, is the starting documents, which
            are pretty clean, and the external stylesheet, residing in
            <a href="styles/spaceinvaders.css">styles/spaceinvaders.css</a>
         </li>
         <li>
            Sound. Both version uses the DOM to create elements
            for playing sound. If the browser used is either Mozilla
            or Galeon, an EMBED element is created, whereas
            BGSOUND is created if Opera is being used.
            <a href="https://bugs.opera.com/show_bug.cgi?id=83554">bug #83554</a>
         </li>
         <li>
            Mouse events. The ship is controlled with the mouse,
            shooting is done by clicking.
            Thus, the application tests onmousemove and onclick
            mouse events.
         </li>
         <li>
            Keyboard events. just game commands like "pause"
            and "do you wish to continue y/n"
         </li>
         <li>
            Concurrence. A <strong>lot</strong> of setTimeout()
            and setInterval(). Everything that has a predictable motion,
            has a setInterval(), such as bombs, missiles and alien movement.
            A lot of setTimeout() is used, e.g. typewriting and explosions.
         </li>
         <li>
            Currently, these demos works best in
            <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla 1.0/1.1</a> and
            <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/">Galeon 1.2.5</a>.
            The ASCII version works *pretty good* in Opera 7 build 2131 and
            <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">IE 6</a>
            now plays both versions (&nbsp;after some modifcations to the code&nbsp;),
            but has huge problems whith transparent PNG images, so the figures on screen
            look a little odd.

            <a href="ie_issues.html">IE issues I encountered when making the game play in IE 5.5/6</a>
            Unsupported JavaScript methods and properties, difference in DOM implementation and
            how to work around them in Explorer.

               Browser support for event object properties.
            </a>This is an overview made when developing the SpaceInvaders. It handles the
            browsers Opera 6, Opera 7, Mozilla 1.1 and Internet Explorer 6 and their support
            for the different event object properties.
