    <h2>Demo menu system</h2>
    <p>
      This is a rather straight forward menu system, which can be configured
      to use various DHTML features to create the HTML for the menus and for
      handling events.
    </p>

      Jens Lindstr&ouml;m <a href="mailto:jl@opera.com">&lt;jl@opera.com&gt;</a> 
      wrote this. It's quite possible that there are bugs in the menu system.
      If you find one, please report it.

    <h2>Versions</h2>
    <p>
      There are three versions:
      <dl>
        <dt><a href="menusystem-document.write.html">menusystem-document.write.html</a></dt>
        <dd>
          Uses document.write to create the HTML and registers event handlers
          using HTML attributes (<... onclick="...">).  Works in Opera 6, but doesn't
          look so nice.
        </dd>

        <dt><a href="menusystem-innerHTML.html">menusystem-innerHTML.html</a></dt>
        <dd>
          Uses innerHTML and insertAdjacentHTML to create the HTML and registers 
          event handlers by assigning to event properties (element.onlick = ...).
        </dd>

        <dt><a href="menusystem-dom2.html">menusystem-dom2.html</a></dt>
        <dd>
          Uses createElement, createTextNode and appendChild to create the HTML and
          registers event handlers using addEventListener.
        </dd>
     </p>
     <p>
       The three versions only differ in assignments to properties on a global object
       'features' which controls how the code in <a href="menusystem.js">menusystem.js</a>
       behaves. The different possible configurations are documented in the beginning
       of <a href="menusystem.js">menusystem.js</a>.
     </p>
     <h2>Known problems</h2>
     <p>
       The document.write-based example doesn't work (it is probably the registering of
       event handlers as HTML attributes that doesn't work). The problem causes an alert
       to be displayed with an error message in.
     </p>
     <p>
       If you are using MSIE for some reason, you need to add "features.MSIE_compatible = true;"
       somewhere, as MSIE's event objects are a bit limited. That should work with Opera too,
       and possibly with Mozilla.
