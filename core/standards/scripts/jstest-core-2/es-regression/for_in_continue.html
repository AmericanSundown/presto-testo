<h1>Continue inside for..in loop</h1>

<p>A bug in the implementation of <b>for..in</b> statements would
abort the script if there was a <b>continue</b> executed in the body
of the loop; you would only see the first two lines of the expected
output in this test.  The problem was fixed for ECMAScript module
version linear_a_1_beta_9.</p>

<p>The below should read: "Before loop", "Thing in 0", "Thing in 1", "After loop".</p>

<script>
var ting = [ "fisk", "fnys" ];

document.writeln("<p>Before loop");

for (a in ting)
{
  document.writeln("<p>Thing in " + a);
  continue;
  document.writeln("<p>Thing out  " + a);
}  

document.writeln("<p>After loop");
</script>
