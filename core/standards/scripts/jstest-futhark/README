This is the JSTest module: a test suite for ECMAScript, JavaScript,
DOM, LiveConnect, and related technologies, and Opera's implementation
of these.

Load index.html into your web browser, and take it from there.

Some tests require a little bit of localization.  You can edit
testconfig.js in this directory to set this up.

The testsuite module is created from a small toplevel module called
jstest2-toplevel (which contains this file among others) together with
testsuites extracted from the various source code modules in the CVS.
