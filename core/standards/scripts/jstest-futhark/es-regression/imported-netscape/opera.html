<h1>Netscape's JavaScript test suite (ca 1998)</h1>

<p>I found this floating around in the old 'ecmascript' module on our
CVS server.  It appears to be a Netscape testsuite that was published
in 1998. The HTML infrastructure is something I hacked up one evening,
based on what was already in place.  (The tests are not designed to be
run many to a file, the way I've put them together; there's a slight
chance that my hacks will make some tests fail.  Haven't found any
problems yet.)</p>

<p>Generally the logic seems to be that the base case is the
ECMAScript v1 tests, and then the other tests build on that suite,
testing only changes relative to ECMAScript v1.  (The "JavaScript"
tests test only the core language, by the way.)</p>

<p>Some of the tests are wonderfully Netscape-specific and will be
removed or changed, as appropriate.</p>

<p>The test suite installs an onerror handler to take care of
execution errors but Opera does not support this, so execution errors
are reported to the error console and must be inspected
separately.</p>
