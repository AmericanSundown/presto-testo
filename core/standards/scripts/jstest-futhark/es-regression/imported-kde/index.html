<h1>KDE ECMAScript/JavaScript test suite</h1>

<p>These tests were downloaded from the <a
href="http://webcvs.kde.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/khtmltests/">KDE CVS
site</a> on 2002-08-13 and 2002-08-14 by <a
href="mailto:lth@opera.com">lth@opera.com</a>.  They have not been
modified except to correct obvious bugs and to make the test harness
function in Opera's existing structure.  Not all tests in the suite
are listed below, as they are implementation-specific.</p>

<a href="ecmascript/index.html">KDE ECMAScript tests</a> (directory <tt>js/</tt> on KDE site)<br>
<a href="javascript/index-all.html">KDE JavaScript tests</a> (directory <tt>ecma/</tt> on KDE site)<br>

<p>(Yes, the directory names are switched on the KDE site.  Go figure.)</p>
