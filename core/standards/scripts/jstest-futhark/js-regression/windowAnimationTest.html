      <h1>Window moveTo() test</h1>
      <p>
         You should see a little window bouncing around the screen, starting in 
         the upper left corner and moving down to the lower right corner, then bouncing upwards
         and so on.
      </p>         
      <p>
         This animation behaves <strong>very</strong> differently on Mac, Windows and Linux.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Linux</strong><br />
         It seems to work best on the Linux version. It moves correctly and the animation is quite
         smooth. It is possible to create several windows, but the old one dies and remains visible on the screen
         when creating a new one. The new window starts its journey from where the old one stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Windows</strong><br />
         It works alright, but the screen update is really poor. It flashes and it doesn't go in the 
         correct directons, it seems to refuse going diagonally, quite often. It's not possible to open 
         multiple anim. windows.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Mac</strong><br />
         Works better than on Windows :-). Moving all around the screen, not just limited to the Opera area.
         However, it goes a lot faster when moving over the "Opera area". Opening new windows doesn't work, you
         must close the anim window, in order to open a new one.
