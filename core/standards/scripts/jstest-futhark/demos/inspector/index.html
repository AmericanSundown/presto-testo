    <h2>DOM inspector</h2>
    <p>
      This is a DOM inspector. It probably needs more user documentation to be
      directly usable.

    <h2>Server side support</h2>
    <p>
      The DOM inspector works by injecting some (quite a lot, in fact) script code
      into a page. For security reasons, this is not something that can actually
      be done straight away on the client side. There are probably two main ways
      to solve this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Adding special support for it in Opera.
      </li>
      <li>
        Letting a simple proxy service insert a script tag into a page and
        serve the resulting page to the client.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The second alternativ is the one I have used so far. There is a Python script
      (<a href="inspector.py">inspector.py</a>) that asks for an url, loads the url,
      inserts a script tag (and a base tag to make relative urls work as intended)
      and sends the result to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Python script itself is a very quick hack, and will most likely not work
      with all pages (or work at all in all cases). But it works in some cases, and
      that is good enough, right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The script is currently available via
      <a href="http://i100.ryd.student.liu.se/~whiskey/js/inspector/inspector.py">
      my home computer on my student Internet connection</a>. It probably won't be
      there forever, especially since I'm already not actually a student.
    </p>
    <h2>Known problems</h2>
    <p>
      The inspector highlights the currently selected element by adding a one-pixel
      border and changing its color to different colours (all red). Properly restoring
      the border when the element is no longer selected requires DOM CSS support
      that Opera 7 currently doesn't have. This results in borders being left or
      old borders not being restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      It generally doesn't seem to work very well. That is something we'll have to
      fix.
