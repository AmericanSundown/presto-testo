<p>This test case checks that it is not possible to read the contents
of an iframe by means of a javascript: URL in a link.  This bug was
reported by Andreas Sandblad to support, we do not have a bug number
for it.</p>

<p>This example reads cookies but it can also be used to read
directory contents and the usual set of things.</p>

<p>When you click on the link 'sniff' you should either get an alert
with a cookie (fetched from www.google.com), or nothing should happen.
If you get an alert then the security check is not working; if a
cookie is displayed then something is definitely wrong, otherwise, it
may be that www.google.com no longer supplies cookies.  If nothing
happens, then security has not been violated.</p>

<p>(If you do not see content in the iframe, then the test will not
work.  Also, if you are loading this page from www.google.com then the
test will not behave as described.)</p>
