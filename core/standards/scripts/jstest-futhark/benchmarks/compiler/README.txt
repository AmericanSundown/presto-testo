These are benchmarks for testing the performance of the bytecode
compiler (not the performance of the compiled code).  They are
mostly useful when run under a profiler.

manysmall.html has about 3500 trivial event handlers and stresses the
overall cost of compiling tiny programs.

money.html is derived from money.cnn.com and contains many scripts,
some of them quite large, from that site.

Ideas:
  - www.theregister.co.uk is known to be a hard site, it has 100-150
    scripts, some of them large, some of them trivial.
