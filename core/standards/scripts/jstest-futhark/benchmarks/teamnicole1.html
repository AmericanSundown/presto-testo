<p>Abstracted from www.teamnicole.com.</p>

<p>The program starts out with a 30K characters long string, which it
repeatedly searches for a pattern.  When it finds the pattern it
creates a new string with a string substituted for the pattern.  Then
it repeats the process on the new string.</p>

<p>This is a really clueless way of doing things.</p>

<p>Anyway, this program can take quite a while to run in Opera 7.0x and
earlier.  On my 2GHz system it takes about 40 seconds.</p>
