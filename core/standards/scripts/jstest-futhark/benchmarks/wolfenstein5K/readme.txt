Winner of the 2002 competition.  Note how much faster it is in MSIE 5 than in Opera 7.

AUTHOR'S DESCRIPTION: Blow the heads off the monsters in this
texture-mapped, first-person shooter crammed into 5K of JavaScript.

REQUIRES: 
Windows users: IE5 or IE6 
Mac users: Netscape 4.77

INSTRUCTIONS: Use J,K, and L to move, SPACE to shoot, M to back up.
The status bar contains your score, the number of monsters left on the
level, and your health meter. The farther away a monster is when you
shoot it, the more points. When you kill enough monsters, you move to
the next level.  Get the med kits to increase your health. When your
health disappears, you are dead. Reload the page to play again.
