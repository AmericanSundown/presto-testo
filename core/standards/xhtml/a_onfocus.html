<!-- Purpose: To test the ONFOCUS attribute of the A element tag-->

<!-- Expected result: Clicking on the link should cause a Javascript alert dialog box to display and should bring up Netscape's home page -->

<p>This tests the ONFOCUS attribute of the A element tag. In this

case, ONFOCUS occurs when mouse is clicked down.</p>



<p>When the mouse is clicked down, a Javascript alert dialog box

will display with the following message: 'You focused on the link

and as a result, this dialog box was generated'. After the ONFOCUS

event has happened, click 'OK' in the Javascript dialog box and you

should link to Netscape's home page</p>



<a

onfocus="alert('You focused on the link and as a result, this dialog box was generated')"

 href="http://home.netscape.com">Link</a>
