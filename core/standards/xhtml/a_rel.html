<!-- Purpose: To test the REL attribute of the A(ANCHOR) element. The REL attribute defines a link relationship from the current document to the linked document. This test uses the REL attribute to identify that this document is the source of the link to the target page-->

<!-- Expected result: There is no actual result. Rather, the REL attribute value identifies the relationship from the current document to the linked document -->
