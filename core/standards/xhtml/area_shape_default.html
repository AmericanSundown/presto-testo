<!-- Purpose: To test the omission of the SHAPE attribute of the AREA element. This test omits the SHAPE attribute for the red square -->

<!-- Expected result: A gif imagemap should be displayed with 1 red square and a white background. The SHAPE attribute has been omitted for the red square but the default should be "rect". Clicking on the red square should link to a separate HTML page. The linked page should describe the square you clicked on in the imagemap. Clicking on the white background space should link to a 'default destination' page. -->
