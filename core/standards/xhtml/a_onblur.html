<!-- Purpose: To test the ONBLUR attribute of the A element tag. The ONBLUR attribute specifies a script function to be executed when the element loses focus. In this case, the element loses focus when the user clicks on another item with the mouse-->

<!-- Expected result: Losing focus on the link should generate a Javascript alert dialog box and, after clicking 'OK', the user should link to the anchor at the bottom of the page -->

<title>HTML Functional -- A - ONBLUR</title>

<script type="JavaScript">

<body>

<p>This tests the ONBLUR attribute of the A element tag. ONBLUR

occurs when you lose focus. In this case, the user will lose focus

AFTER the link is clicked. Upon focus loss, a Javascript alert

dialog box will display with the following message: 'You lost focus

by unclicking the link. As as result, this dialog box was

generated'. After you click 'OK' on the dialog box, you should link

to the anchor at the bottom of the page.</p>



Clicking <a

onblur="alert('You lost focus by unclicking the link. As a result, this dialog box was generated')"

 href="a_onblur.html#anchor">here</a> should link to the anchor at the bottom of

the page <br />
