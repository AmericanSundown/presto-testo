Some quotation that they could recognise from Shakespeare or from Melodies would be better.

He would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry which they could not understand. They would think that he was airing his superior education. He would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl in the pantry. He had taken up a wrong tone. His whole speech was a mistake from first to last, an utter failure.</q></div>
