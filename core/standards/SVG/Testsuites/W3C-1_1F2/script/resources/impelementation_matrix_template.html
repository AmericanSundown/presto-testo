    <h1>SVG Full 1.1 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition <span>Conformance Suite Implementation Status</span></h1>
    <div>
    <h2>May 2011</h2>
    <p>
      This document describes the results of particular SVG 1.1 implementations tested against the 
      <a href="../archives/W3C_SVG_11_TestSuite.tar.gz">SVG Full 1.1 2nd Edition Test Suite</a>. 
      The goal is to demonstrate that every part of the 
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/">SVG Full 1.1 2nd Edition Candidate Recommendation specification</a> 
      can be implemented, as required by the SVG Candidate Recommendation exit criteria. 
      For this, each test must be passed by at least two implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not  an exhaustive test of all SVG implementations; the implementations listed 
      here are the ones that were readily available at the time of testing.  This 
      is also not a formal conformance certification, and thus does not rank the implementations. The purpose is 
      purely to show that the SVG specification can be and has been implemented, and to 
      demonstrate a good degree of interoperability between implementations.
    </p> 
    <h3>Implementations Tested</h3>
    <p>
      The following table lists the implementations that were tested as well as the particular 
      version and the profile that the implementation is targetted at.
