Activating the Rectangle link should cause the whole of linking-uri-01-b.svg to be
displayed, which is visually similar similar to linking-uri-02-b.svg.
</li>
<li>
Assuming that a "back" action has been requested, activating the Ellipse link 
should cause the initial picture to be replaced in the
frame by the whole ellipse element, uniformly scaled, with its boxing rect
just inside the frame.
                </li>
<li>
Assuming that a "back" action has
been requested, activating the Polygon link should cause the initial 
picture to remain unchanged within the frame, except that the polygon is
"highlighted" (the meaning of highlighted is not further specified).
</li>
<li>
Assuming that a "back" action has been requested, 
activating the Circle link should cause the initial picture to be replaced in the
frame by the whole whole element, non-uniformly scaled so that it is stretched
horizontally into an ellipse, with its boxing rect just inside the frame.
