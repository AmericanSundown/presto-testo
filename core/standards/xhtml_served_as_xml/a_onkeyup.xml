<p>This page tests the ONKEYUP attribute of the A element tag. Once

the link has focus, the user presses a key down. Then the user

breaks contact with the key which will cause a Javascript alert

dialog box to be displayed with the following message: 'Key was

pressed down and then released!'.</p>



<a href="http://www.netscape.com"

onkeyup="window.alert ('Key was pressed down and then released!')">Focus

the mouse on this link, then press a key down, then break contact

with the key</a>
