<p>
	This is an automated test suite for web forms with the feature set
	defined in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">HTML 4</a>.
</p>

<p>
	As the HTML 4 spec is somewhat lacking in its specification of form
	elements, the expected results of the tests are based upon <a
	href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/">HTML
	5</a>.  However, features <em>added</em> in HTML 5 (WebForms 2) are not
	covered in this test suite.
</p>


<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>
	The scripts ending with <span class="file">*.rb</span> automatically runs
	through the tests in the <span class="file">/interactive</span> directory.
	The <span class="file">/res</span> directory contains some helper files, and
	the <span class="file">/elements</span> contains all the scripts for the
	various form elements.  The tests themselves are categorized in groups based
	on their function, followed by a number indicating the test's successive
	order.  An example:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>input-text:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="file">input-text-001.html</span></li>
		<li><span class="file">input-text-002.html</span></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>input-text-i18n:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="file">input-text-i18n-001.html</span></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>input-text-value:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="file">input-text-value-001.html</span></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>input-password:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="file">input-password-001.html</span></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
	There is also <a href="list.html">a listing of all the tests</a>.
</p>

<p>
	There are two types of tests in this test suite.  There is the
	traditional interactive test; where you point and click at elements,
	enter data, and so forth; and there are (semi-)reference tests,
	involving the comparison of results.  There are a few things
	interactive tests are unable to test for, such as the correct
	rendering of a button, that an image of a certain type is displayed,
	or that animated GIFs are indeed displayed correctly.  In these cases
	we use reference tests.
</p>

<p>
	This means that the Web Forms 1 test suite is not a traditional test
	suite focusing on only one types of tests.  It is designed to cover
	all aspects of form elements, as specified int he HTML 4
	specification.  Although the tests are designed to be performed
	automatically, it is fully possible to run this test suite manually.
</p>

<p>
	In some cases the individual tests will use other client- and server
	side languages to facilitate testing.  Specifically, we are using
	JavaScript to interact with the <abbr title="Document Object
	Model">DOM</abbr> and to simulate and test certain behaviour.  Many of
	the tests also test communication with the server, for instance that an
	input text element is able to send <em>x</em> characters to the server
	through POST or GET).  This is accomodated using PHP and a web server.
</p>


<h2>Running the test suite</h2>

<p>
	The test suite can be run using Opera 10.5 (or later) or an internal
	Opera core build (latest is always recommended).  You must have JRuby
	1.4 and RSpec installed.  For some of the tests you will need
	ECMAScript enabled.  Some of the tests rely on HTTP server
	communication and PHP.
</p>

<p>
	To run all tests:
</p>

<code><pre>
  % jruby -S spec wf1.rb
</pre></code>

<p>
	You can also run a subset of the tests:
</p>

<code><pre>
  % jruby -S spec elements/input-checkbox.rb
</pre></code>


<h2>OperaWatir specifics</h2>

<p>
	This suite is written with Opera's implementation of <a
		href="http://watir.com/">Watir</a> in mind, called
	<em>OperaWatir</em>.  Although it should be possible to run the suite
	on any Watir implementation, it makes use of some Opera-specific
	functionality.  Specifically, this extra functionality is found in the
	<code>get_hash()</code>, <code>take_screenshot()</code> and
	<code>compare_hash()</code> methods.  This will allow automated
	reference testing by transfering a screenshot's hash over the Opera
	interface protocol, dubbed <a
	href="http://dragonfly.opera.com/app/scope-interface/">SCOPE</a>.
</p>

<p>
	This hash comparison technique allows us not only to compare
	screenshots of two separate pages, but also of independent elements
	<em>within</em> the same page.  For instance, it will cut both time
	and load if we are (1) not needed to load a second reference page, and
	(2) not required to take screenshots of the entire screen.  This is
	how reference-like tests are implemented in this test suite:
</p>

<code><pre>
  it "reference test" do
    browser.goto "http://example.com/sometest.html"
    browser.div(:id, "test").compare_hash(browser.div(:id, "reference")).should == true
  end
</pre></code>

<p>
	For some tests, such as when comparing images or static content (not
	including system fonts or other dynamic elements), it is possible to
	use one or several predefined hash values to cut the expens of
	reference tests further.  An example of this:
</p>

<code><pre>
  # Specify all hashes for valid images here.
  pass_images = ["0x774a611291fb86b6b11a2b089fa531e7"]

  it "reference test" do
    browser.goto "http://example.com/sometest.html"
    browser.button(:name, "test").take_screenshot("", pass_images, 0)
  end
</pre></code>

<p>
	This method is however not used in this test suite.  References are
	always given, so that the tests can be run manually.
</p>


<h2>Covered areas</h2>

<p>
	The following elements are finished and is covered by this test suite:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>input
	<ul>
		<li>text</li>
		<li>password</li>
		<li>checkbox</li>
		<li>radio</li>
		<li>submit</li>
		<li>reset</li>
		<li>hidden</li>
		<li>image</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>button</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The following is either incomplete or have not been started
	altogether:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>input
	<ul>
		<li>file</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>label</li>
	<li>select</li>
	<li>textarea</li>
</ul>


<h2>Further work</h2>

<p>
	<em>All</em> the tests requires reviewing.  There are most certainly
	bugs in the current code, some things may have been covered in
	inaccurate ways, and some features may not have made it in to the
	tests.
