           <LI> The SMC exists only as a figment of this author's
           imagination, and perhaps that of a few interested parties
           [grazzi ħafna!]
           <LI> While I (Steven) feel that this work is probably too
           preliminary for public consumption, please pass it along to
           anyone you think might be interested.
      <P></OL>

   <LI> <H3>Purpose</H3> - Overview

      <OL>
           <LI> To identify, collect, and publish standards pertaining
           to Maltese in electronic form.
           
           <LI> To actively promote and encourage the use of Maltese
           in business, education, government, and personal computer
           use.

      <P></OL>

   <LI> <H3> Standards </H3>

      <OL>
          <LI> <H4>Reasoning</H4>
          <OL>
             <LI> Having a standard would encourage use, by adding
             `weight' to the idea of Maltese text processing.

             <LI> Standards allow data interchange between
             organizations.
             
             <LI> Standards allow compliance and consistency testing.  
             
             <LI> Once accepted in the minds of relevant parties,
             standards provide easy labelling of a set of features.

             <LI> <B>Examples</B>
               <OL>
                  <LI> ASCII [ISO-646] - has served the world well
               since the 1960's or so, allowing disparate computers to
               communicate -- in English and English-like languages.
               <P></OL>

            <LI> <FONT SIZE=-2>It's true that the industry, and common usage may
               take some time to catch up to 'ideal' Maltese usage -
               short term and phase-in plans may need to be
               considered.  However, we should design for the ideal
               that's best for the language and the people first, and
               only secondarily consider technical aspects.  Maltese
               is not a difficult language for the computer to
               support!  Consider Japanese, with it's two alphabets
               and tens of thousands of symbols.  </FONT>

          <LI> <B>Text encoding</B>
            <OL>
               <LI> Today, most software is oriented towards English
               and its 26 letter alphabet, with a fair amount of
               support for 'Western European' characters (i.e. ISO
               8859-1, Latin-1). 

                <A NAME="alphabet"></A>
               <LI> The Maltese alphabet requires the characters:
               <U>ċ</U> (C Dot), <U>ġ</U> (G Dot), <U>ħ</U> (H Cross),
               and <U>ż</U> (Z Dot).   All of these have upper and
               lowercase variations. - 8 characters in total. In
               addition, <U>għ</U> and <U>ie</U> are digraphs which
               are probably best encoded as a combination of 'g' and
               'ħ', etc.  In keyboard input and in sorting, they need
               to be treaded as single characters.
                 <UL>
                    <LI> <I>Q: What other languages use these
                        characters, for reference? According to
                        Unicode 3.0:</I><UL>
                        ċ,ġ are used in old Irish Gaelic orthography<BR>
                        ħ is <I>similar</I> to Cyrillic small letter 'tshe'.<BR>
                        ż is used in polish<BR>
                        </UL>
                 <P></UL>
               
               <LI> Two encodings (both ISO) which support these
               letters are  ISO-10646-1 (Unicode) and ISO-8859-3 (Latin-3). 
               
               <UL>
                  <LI> ISO-10646-1 is a character set more commonly
                   referred to as 'Unicode'. ( <A
               HREF="http://www.unicode.org/">
               <TT>http://www.unicode.org</TT></A>)  Unicode encodes
               these eight characters in the Latin block. It is 
               quite widespread in it's adoption.  There is a simple 8-bit
               encoding for Unicode called UTF-8, recognized by almost all
               browsers.

               <LI> ISO-8859-3, or UTF-8, seems much less well
               known. It does contain all eight needed characters.  Since
               this is a simple 8-bit encoding, ISO-8859-3 could be used
               as an interchange format to pass text through
               non-compliant software which expects Latin-1. 
               In addition, it may be easier to make keyboard layouts
               for windows 9x and the Macintosh using latin-3, as these
               systems do not support Unicode as their underlying format.
               See: <A HREF="http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html#ISO-8859-3">http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html</A>

               <LI> A variety of ad-hoc encodings have been developed,
               some around using the letters <UL>[]{};':</UL>, for
               instance, for easy keyboard entry.  Two of the
               best-known encodings seem to be for the fonts Tornado,
               and MalteseTimes, respectively.
