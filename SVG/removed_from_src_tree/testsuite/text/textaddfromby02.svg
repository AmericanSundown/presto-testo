<title>from-by-animation of text</title> 
<desc>from-by-animation of the x attribute of the text element.
The text attribute x changes for a blue '?!$' with to by animations.

If the behaviour is assumed to be additive, this results in as 
simulated with a values animations for the red '?!$'.

For non additive behaviour:
In SVG1.1 error processing could be used 
(stop/do not start such a 'stupid' animation and indicate this).
In SVG1.2 it is noted 'If any values are not legal, they are considered 
to be unsupported and is (are?) processed as if they had not been 
specified.' But as far as I can see, SVG1.2 has no specific rule, what
to do, if there is no sufficient values, to, by (or path) information 
at all in an animation element, therefore SMIL2 error processing
might be used. This means, such stupid animation elements have no
effect on presentation, but the timing can still be used to derive some
timing information for example for dependent animations.
This behaviour is indicated in grey (currently without a test, that timing
information can be derived from such an animation).



Behaviour of different viewers:
Adobe plugin (3.01 Beta Release 1, Build 88): additive behaviour
Squiggle 1.7: additive behaviour
Opera 8.x: no animation of blue test case at all
Opera9tp1: wrong positioning, but additive behaviour
Opera9tp2/beta1: animates somehow
Opera9beta2/ 9.00/9.10: no animation of blue test case at all
Opera9.50 alpha/beta: animates somehow
