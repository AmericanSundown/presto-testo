<title>to-animation of text</title> 
<desc>to-animation of the x attribute of the text element.
The text attribute x changes for a blue '?!$' with two to animations

to-animations are in general a mixture of additive and non-additive
behaviour. While in SMIL2 there is still some text, not obvious, whether
this is informative or normative that seems to implicate, that additive
behaviour is required, anyway this is clarified in the current SMIL3
draft in such a way, that this paragraph is indicated to be only 
informative. The normative behaviour is simply defined by a
formula, applicable for any list of numbers or entities, that can
be treated somehow on a numeral basis.

This behaviour here is a smooth motions (a quadratic time dependence) as 
simulated using keySplines for the red '?!$'.




Behaviour of different viewers:
Adobe plugin (3.01 Beta Release 1, Build 88): shows additive behaviour
Squiggle 1.7: no to animation of blue test case at all 
Opera 8.x, 9tp1: no to animation of blue test case at all 
Opera9tp2/ beta1/2: red comparison not animated, 
                   surprising partly discrete, partly continuous behaviour for the blue test case 
Opera9.00/9.10: no to animation of blue test case at all 
Opera9.50 alpha/beta: surprising partly discrete, partly continuous behaviour for the blue test case
