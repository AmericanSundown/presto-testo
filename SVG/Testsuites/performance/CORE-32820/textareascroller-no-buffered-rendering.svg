      Why did you bring us here? We're rescuing ya. Ooh, name it after me! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</tspan>

      Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. You know, I was God once. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! And then the battle's not so bad?

      You can see how I lived before I met you. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. You lived before you met me?!

    Fry, we have a crate to deliver. I didn't ask for a <tspan font-style="italic">completely reasonable</tspan> excuse! I asked you to get busy! I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! No! The cat shelter's on to me.<tbreak/><tbreak/>
    No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Say it in Russian! Yeah, lots of people did. [soto voce] Pansy. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

      No, I'm Santa Claus! [having quickly written a book to trap the Big Brain in] There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! And then the battle's not so bad? Shut up and get to the point!

I love you, buddy! I'll get my kit! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! I wish! It's a nickel. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</tspan>
