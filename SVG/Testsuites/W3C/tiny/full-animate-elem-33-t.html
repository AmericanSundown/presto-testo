Each of the 4 sub-tests has a purple circle which moves along a path. The path is indicated with 
a dashed line and sample points where the circle should pass a certain position on the path is indicated with gray circles. 
On top of each gray circle is a number which indicates the passing time in seconds. In the cases where the purple circle should 
pass the gray circle two times the first passing time is written above the gray circle and the second passing time is written below.
