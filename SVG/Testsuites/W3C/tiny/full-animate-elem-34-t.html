The first test is a polygon shaped as a digit. The polygon has an animation on its vertex points which
morphs the polygon between the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. The gray outlines indicates the expected position 
of the polygon at 1, 2, 3 and 4s.

<p>
The second test is 4 paths in a u-shape. The expected result is that one path at a time is filled.
Which path that should be filled at which time is indicated by the number above it.
