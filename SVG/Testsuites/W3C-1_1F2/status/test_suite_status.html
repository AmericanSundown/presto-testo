        Test 'additive' and 'accumulate' attributes.
      
      
        The four pictures show the effect with the four possible combinations of
        'additive' (either 'replace' or 'sum') and 'accumulate' (either 'none' or 'sum').
        Because two animations are animating the height, the effects of 'additive' and
        'accumulate' are sometimes different than when there is only a single animation.

        Test inheritance of animated properties.
      
      
        Three colored text strings appear. All three are inside of the same
        'g' element. The 'g' element has its 'font-size' animated from 30 to
        40, and its 'fill' from #00f (blue) to #070 (green).
      
      
        The first colored 'text' element has the font-size set, so the
        animation of the parent 'g' only affects the fill color. The second
        has the fill set and font-size set, so no inherited values are
        used. The font-size and fill color stay constant. The third colored
        'text' element has neither of these properties specified and thus
        inherits both animated values - the fill color changes and the text
        grows in size.

        Two animations have been defined that move a triangle along a path. The first animation specifies rotate='auto', which causes

        Two animations have been defined. For each animation, ruler lines and text are provided to help show what the correct behavior is.
        The black text and ruler lines help show the sizes and movement of the rectangles over time.
      
      
        The discrete animations should show stair-stepping animations, with quantum-level jumps every two seconds in these tests. The linear
        animations change constantly with each keyframe to keyframe section, with the result that the change is faster when there is a larger
        change within a given amount of time. The paced animations change constantly over the entire animation, regardless of the values at
        particular keyframes. For calcMode='spline' in this test case, the initial rate of change is defined to be the same as linear, but the
        last jump has an ease-in/ease-out effect where the change is slower at the start and end but faster in the middle.

        Test for chained animations.
      
      
        The assumption is that you will first click on "fade in" and
        then click on "fade out", each exactly once. The first time you
        select the link 'fade in', you should see a blue square appearing,
        gradually and smoothly fading from white to blue over the
        course of three seconds. This square is in front of and thus
        obscures the lower left circle, but is behind the upper right
        circle. The fill color of these circles is also animated, from white to
        grey. The animations are triggered by the start of the corresponding
        animation of the blue square.
      
      
        With the second click on "fade in", however, the behavior might
        be different. In the case of having a first click on "fade in",
        waiting three seconds, and then immediately perform a first click
        on "fade out", waiting three seconds, and then immediately perform
        a second click on "fade in", you should see the following. After
        the first click on "fade in", the blue square goes from white to blue. 
        After the first click on "fade out", the blue square goes
        from blue to white. After the second click on "fade in",
        however, the blue square goes from white to blue, and then
        goes back from blue to white. This is because of the
        hyperlinking rules as they relate to resolved start times in the
        SMIL Animation specification.

        animates an XML attribute and does set 'attributeType' to 'XML'.
      
      
        The left rectangle animates its height from 100 to 50,
        starting at time 3 seconds and ending at 6 seconds.
        The right rectangle animates its height from 100 to 50,

        The leftmost rectangle verifies the use of the 'xlink:href'
        attribute to indicate the target element to be animated.
        The rightmost rectangle verifies animating the parent of
        the 'animate' element (in this case, a 'rect' element)
        (i.e., the implicit parent of the 'animate' element).
      
      
        At time 0, two rectangles filled with blue and stroked with
        light blue appear, each with width=100 and height=160. Starting at
        time 3 seconds and ending at time 6 seconds, the height of
        the leftmost rectangle decreases from 160 to 40. Starting at

        The purpose of this test is to test animateMotion with keyPoints and keyTimes.
      
      
        The test consists of 4 sub-tests. Each test has a purple circle which moves along a path. The path is indicated with a dashed line and sample points where the circle should pass a certain position on the path is indicated with gray circles. On top of each gray circle is a number which indicates the passing time in seconds. In the cases where the purple circle should pass the gray circle two times the first passing time is written above the gray circle and the second passing time is written below.
      
      
        Section 19.2.12 in the spec. states that a motion path is defined by the path attribute or by values or from/to attributes. So in the animateMotion case, values is just used for defining the motionPath and the number of values do not have to relate to the number of keyTimes.

        The purpose of this test is to test animation of attributes points and fill-rule.
      
      
        The test consists of 2 sub-tests. The first test is a polygon shaped as a digit. The polygon
        has an animation on its vertex points which  morphs the polygon between the numbers 1, 2, 3
        and 4. The gray outlines indicates the expected position of the polygon at 1, 2, 3 and 4s.
        The second test is 4 paths in a u-shape. They have animated fill-rules. Their initial
        fill-rules are, from left to right, nonzero, evenodd, nonzero (by default value, no fill-rule attribute set)
        and nonzero (by default value, no fill-rule attribute set). This means, that the second path is
        initially u-shaped, and all other paths are initially rect-shaped. All four animations are set to evenodd as a last stage.
        The further expected result is that one path at a time is filled. The other three paths are not filled but have the u-shape.
        The fourth animation from evenodd to nonzero happens by going back to the initial state,
        because the fill attribute is not set to freeze. Which path that should be filled at
        which time is indicated by the number above it (indicating time in seconds). To enhance the
        difference between the filled path and the rest, the filled path should always have the
        same color as the morphing polygon. This is achieved by a discrete color animation.

        For the &lt;a&gt; animation, showing on the left-most column, the number
        indicates the number of the animation test currently linked by the xlink:href
        attribute. For example, when the xlink:href animated value is "animate-elem-38-t.svg",
        the text displays "38". When the user clicks on the displayed number, the user
        agent should open the corresponding link. For example, if the user clicks on 38,
        then the "animate-elem-38-t.svg" URI should be followed. If the user clicks on 02,
        then the "animate-elem-02-t.svg" URI should be followed.
      
      
        For the &lt;image&gt; animations, the image xlink:href attribute cycles through

        "Use A" and "Use B". The change should happen every second and the text shown

        The second one tests animating x, y values where there are values for each
        of the text's characters. For that test (bottom left), there is a set of
        reference markers for each of the characters ('1' and '2').
      
      
        For width and height animation (the two tests on the bottom right), the
        outline showing the expected width and height at given points in the animation
        is highlighted at the time the marker's width and height should match that
        of the target element.

        The purpose of this test is to test eventbase targets.
      
      
        The test consists of 4 rectangles named A, B, C, D. The D rectangle contains
        three animations changing the color of the animation target.
        Each animation applies to one of the other rectangles
        by using xlink:href. Clicking on rect A should change it's
        color immediately, clicking B changes its color after 2 seconds,
        clicking C changes its color after 4 seconds and clicking D shows no visible change
        (although D contains the animations the event target for each
        animation is the referenced rectangle, this rectangle is also the
        animation target.)
      
      
        The following sections in the SMIL Animation spec (http://www.w3.org/TR/smil-animation/)
        are relevant as confirmation of this test:
        The SMIL spec(3.6.7 subsection "Event Values") states that "If the
        Eventbase-element term is missing, the event-base element is defined to
        be the target element of the animation"
        The SMIL spec (3.1 subsection "The target element") says that the
        animation target may be defined explicitly thru the targetElement IDREF
        or href URI.
        So in this test, the animation target is defined through
        xlink:href and the event base per definition is then also this
        referenced element.

        This test performs basic test on the begin attribute,
        assuming support for the &lt;set&gt; element and setting the
        fill attribute on a &lt;rect&gt; element.
      
      
        The test validates the various possibilities for the begin attribute
        value: no specified value, offset value, event base value, sync base
        value, indefinite value, repeat value, accessKey value and wallclock.
      
      
        There is one or several &lt;set&gt; elements for each of the possible begin
        values. For each test, the &lt;set&gt; element(s) has (or have) an indefinite
        duration and no other timing attribute specified other than begin
        and dur.
      
      
        There are two sets of vertical markers which help check that the test
        is handled properly by the user agent. The first set, on the left, shows
        markers from 0s to 8s, where the times are offset from the document's load time.
        The rectangles in that area should turn green at the time corresponding
        to the column they are in. From example, the first rectangle (going left to right)
        on the "sync base" line should turn green 2 seconds after the document's load.
        The second set of time vertical markers shows offset from a particular event.
        For example, for the event base, the markers show an offset to the time
        the first event base rectangle (the left-most one) is clicked on. For the
        accessKey line, the times show offsets from the time the 'a' key is pressed
        and the document has focus.
      
      
        The first &lt;set&gt; has an unspecified begin attribute. That value
        defaults to an offset of 0s so the animation should apply as soon as
        the document is loaded.
      
      
        The second &lt;set&gt; has its begin attribute set to '2s'. So its
        target rectangle should turn green two seconds after the document is
        loaded.
      
      
        The third &lt;set&gt; has its begin attribute set to an event base
        value 'click'. The user has to click on the left-most target red rectangle
        to make the &lt;set&gt; target turn green. There are two rectangles
        with associated &lt;set&gt; elements. The left most ones has a simple
        value (no offset) and the second one is offset from the event time by 2 seconds.
      
      
        The fourth &lt;set&gt; elements have their begin attributes set to a sync base
        value. The first two rectangles have &lt;set&gt; elements synchronized on their sync base
        begin. The left-most one has no offset and the following one has a 2 seconds offset.
        The last two rectangles have &lt;set&gt; elements synchronized on their sync base end.
        The first one (i.e., the third from left to right on that line), has a 2 seconds
        negative offset. The second one (i.e., the last one on the line) has no offset and should
        begin at the time its sync base ends.
      
      
        The fifth &lt;set&gt; has its begin attribute set to indefinite and
        should not turn red and stay green.
      
      
        The sixth &lt;set&gt;s have their begin attributes have their begin attributes
        based on the repeat() function. The repeat they are synchronized on happens
        at 3s. The first &lt;set&gt;, which has no offset, should begin at 3s. The
        second &lt;set&gt;, which has a 2 seconds offset, should start at 5s.
      
      
        The seventh &lt;set&gt;s have their begin attributes set to 'accessKey(a)'.
        The first one has no offset and should become active (and turn the rectangle
        green), as soon as the key 'a' is pressed in the user agent. The second &lt;set&gt;
        has a 2s offset and should become active 2 seconds after the 'a' key is pressed in
        the user agent.
      
      
        The eight's &lt;set&gt; target has its begin attribute set to
        'wallclock()'. Therefore, the target should turn red because the
        target wallclock time is in the past. The SMIL specification states the following about wallclock values in the past:
        "When a begin time is resolved to be in the past (i.e., before the current presentation time), the element begins immediately,
        but acts as though it had begun at the specified time (playing from an offset into the media)." (http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-smil-animation-20010904/#AnimFuncTiming).

        This tests validates multiple begin conditions in the begin attribute,
        assuming support for the &lt;set&gt; element and setting the
        fill attribute on a &lt;rect&gt; element.
      
      
        The test validates the various possibilities for the begin attribute
        value: multiple offset values, multiple event base values, multiple sync base
        values, multiple repeat values, and multiple accessKey values. Finally,
        the test validates that begin values of different kinds can be mixed.
      
      
        The test shows 6 rows where a red rectangle' s x attribute is animated
        with &lt;set&gt; elements.
      
      
        On the first three rows, the red rectangles should show on the left from
        0 to 1s. From 1 to 2s, the rectangles should show on the right. Then
        the rectangles should show on the left from 2 to 4s, then on the right
        again from 4 to 5s and come back to the left position and stay there
        after 5s.
      
      
        On the fourth row, the rectangle's begin condition is event based
        and requires a user click. After the user clicks on the rectangle,
        the rectangle should move to the right position for 1s, then move
        back to the left position for 3 seconds, move again to the right
        position for 1 second before going back to the left position.
      
      
        On the fifth row, the rectangle's begin condition is accessKey based
        and requires a user to press the 'a' key. After the user presses that key
        the rectangle should move to the right position for 1s, then move
        back to the left position for 3 seconds, move again to the right
        position for 1 second before going back to the left position.
      
      
        The last row's rectangle has a begin condition with two offset values
        (1s;4s) and should behave like the rectangles of the first three
        rows for the first 5 seconds of the document's timeline. In addition,
        the begin condition has a click event base and thus, the rectangle
        should move to the right position for one second every time the user
        clicks on it. Finally, the begin condition also has an accessKey condition
        for the 'b' character. Thus, the rectangle should move to the right
        position every time the user presses the 'b' key.

        This test performs basic test on the end attribute,
        assuming support for the &lt;set&gt; element and setting the
        fill attribute on a &lt;rect&gt; element.
      
      
        The test validates the various possibilities for the end attribute
        value: no specified value, offset value, event base value, sync base
        value, indefinite value, repeat value, accessKey value and wallclock.
      
      
        There are one or several &lt;set&gt; elements for each of the possible end
        values. For each test, the &lt;set&gt; element(s) has (or have) an indefinite
        duration and no other timing attribute specified other than end
        and dur.
      
      
        There are two sets of vertical markers which help check that the test
        is handled properly by the user agent. The first set, on the left, shows
        markers from 0s to 8s, where the times are offset from the document's load time.
        The rectangles in that area should turn green at the time corresponding
        to the column they are in. From example, the first rectangle (going left to right)
        on the "sync base" line should turn green 2 seconds after the document's load.
        The second set of time vertical markers shows offset from a particular event.
        For example, for the event base, the markers show an offset to the time
        the first event base rectangle (the left-most one) is clicked on. For the
        accessKey line, the times show offsets from the time the 'a' key is pressed
        and the document has focus.
      
      
        The first &lt;set&gt; has no end attribute and an indefinite duration.
        Since there are no constraints on the active duration (no end attribute) the
        active duration is the same as the simple duration (indefinite). This
        means that the animation begins at 0s and has an indefinite end time.
      
      
        The second &lt;set&gt; has its end attribute set to '2s'. So its
        target rectangle should turn green two seconds after the document is
        loaded.
      
      
        The third &lt;set&gt; has its end attribute set to an event base
        value 'click'. The user has to click on the left-most target red rectangle
        to make the &lt;set&gt; target turn green. There are two rectangles
        with associated &lt;set&gt; elements. The left most ones has a simple
        value (no offset) and the second one is offset from the event time by 2 seconds.
      
      
        The fourth &lt;set&gt; elements have their end attributes set to a sync base
        value. The first two rectangles have &lt;set&gt; elements synchronized on their sync base
        end. The left-most one has no offset and the following one has a 2 seconds offset.
        The last two rectangles have &lt;set&gt; elements synchronized on their sync base end.
        The first one (i.e., the third from left to right on that line), has a 2 seconds
        negative offset. The second one (i.e., the last one on the line) has no offset and should
        end at the time its sync base ends.
      
      
        The fifth &lt;set&gt; has its end attribute set to indefinite and
        should not turn red and stay green.
      
      
        The sixth &lt;set&gt;s have their end attributes have their end attributes
        based on the repeat() function. The repeat they are synchronized on happens
        at 3s. The first &lt;set&gt;, which has no offset, should end at 3s. The
        second &lt;set&gt;, which has a 2 seconds offset, should start at 5s.
      
      
        The seventh &lt;set&gt;s have their end attributes set to 'accessKey(a)'.
        The first one has no offset and should become active (and turn the rectangle
        green), as soon as the key 'a' is pressed in the user agent. The second &lt;set&gt;
        has a 2s offset and should become active 2 seconds after the 'a' key is pressed in
        the user agent.
      
      
        The eight's &lt;set&gt; target has its end attribute set to
        'wallclock()'. The result depends on the presentation time.
        If the document is viewed completely before 2200-06-10T12:34:56Z,
        the rectangle has to be always green. begin is not explicitely set, therefore
        it is zero, dur is indefinite and end is in the future.
        If the document is viewed completely after 2200-06-10T12:34:56Z, the only end
        value is before the implicitely given only begin value and therefore the set
        does not start, the rectangle remains red. If the document is viewed in a time interval started before
        2200-06-10T12:34:56Z and ended after this date, the rectangle will start green at the beginning, change to red at
        2200-06-10T12:34:56Z and will remain red until the end of presentation.

        This tests validates multiple end conditions in the end attribute,
        assuming support for the &lt;set&gt; element and setting the
        dur attribute to 'indefinite'.
      
      
        The test validates the various possibilities for the end attribute
        value: multiple offset values, multiple event base values, multiple sync base
        values, multiple repeat values, and multiple accessKey values. Finally,
        the test validates that end values of different kinds can be mixed.
      
      
        The test shows 6 rows where a red rectangle's  x attribute is animated
        with &lt;set&gt; elements.
      
      
        On the first three rows, the red rectangles should show on the left from
        0 to 1s. From 1 to 2s, the rectangles should show on the right. Then
        the rectangles should show on the left from 2 to 4s, then on the right
        again from 4 to 5s and come back to the left position and stay there
        after 5s.
      
      
        On the fourth row, the rectangle's end condition is event based
        and requires a user click. One of the end condition is defined
        to be 5 seconds prior to the click and one is defined to be 5
        seconds after the click. If the user clicks on the rectangle
        before 5 seconds (in document time), the red rectangle we move
        to the left position 5 seconds after the click (because the
        'click - 5s' end time resolves to a time prior to the begin
        time). If the user clicks after 5 seconds (in document time),
        then the red rectangle moves to the left position immediately because
        the 'click - 5s' time resolves to a time after the begin time.
      
      
        On the fifth row, the rectangle's end condition is accessKey based
        and requires a user to press the 'a' key. The behavior is exactly the
        same as for the previous row, except that the triggering event
        is the 'a' key press.
      
      
        The last row's rectangle has a end condition with two offset values
        (1s;4s) and should behave like the rectangles of the first three
        rows for the first 5 seconds of the document's timeline. In addition,
        the end condition has a click event base and thus, the rectangle
        should immediately move to the left position if the user everytime the user
        clicks clicks on the rectangle when it is on the right position.
        Finally, the end condition also has an accessKey condition
        for the 'b' character. Thus, the rectangle should move to the left
        position every time the user presses the 'b' key and the rectangle is
        on the right position.

        This tests performs basic tests on the dur attribute.
      
      
        The first row shows a red rectangle subject to a &lt;set&gt; animation
        with no begin attribute, no end attribute and a dur attribute set to
        '2s'. Therefore, the animation should be active from 0 to 2 seconds and
        then terminate. Consequently, the rectangle should show on the right
        for the first two seconds, and then move to the left position.
      
      
        The second row shows a red rectangle subject to a &lt;set&gt; animation
        with no begin attribute, no end attribute and a dur attribute set to
        'indefinite'. Therefore, the animation should stay active indefinitely
        and the rectangle should always be on the right position, never on the
        left position.
      
      
        Finally, the third row shows red rectangle subject to a &lt;set&gt; animation
        with no begin attribute, no end attribute and a dur attribute set to
        'media'. In the context of SVG 1.1, this is equivalent to an 'indefinite'
        value. Therefore, the animation should stay active indefinitely
        and the rectangle should always be on the right position, never on the
        left position.

        This tests performs basic tests on the min attribute. The test is based
        on the SMIL specification at:
        http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil-timing.html#Timing-MinMax.
      
      
        Each row in the test shows different rectangles subject to &lt;set&gt;
        animations with different configurations with regards to the min
        attribute. For each row but the last one, the animation should be active
        during the first 5 seconds of the animations where the red rectangle
        should show in the right column. At five seconds into the animation,
        all the rectangles should move to their left position.
      
      
        On the first row, the first &lt;set&gt; animation (left rectangle) has an end value of 5s,
        and no min attribute. The active duration resulting from the end attribute is 5s.
        The first row shows a second rectangle with a &lt;set&gt; animation with
        the same configuration except that the min attribute value is set to
        'media'. Because the &lt;set&gt; element does not define a media, the
        behavior should be as if the attribute was not specified. The active duration (5s)
        of the second &lt;set&gt; animation is therefore not constrained.
      
      
        On the second row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has an end value of 5s,
        and a -6s min attribute. The active duration resulting from the end attribute is 5s.
        The negative min value is invalid and, as per the specification, the behavior should be
        as if the attribute was not specified. The active duration (5s) is therefore not constrained.
      
      
        On the third row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has an end value of 5s,
        and a 3s min attribute. The active duration resulting from the end attribute is 5s.
        The min value is less than the active duration, so the min attribute does not actually
        constrain the active duration.
      
      
        On the fourth row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a dur value of indefinite, an end value of 2s,
        and a 5s min attribute. The active duration resulting from the end attribute would be 2s.
        Because this is less than the min value (2s &lt; 5s) the (min constrained) active duration
        has to be corrected to 5s, despite a simple duration (indefinite) that is greater than the min value.
      
      
        On the fifth row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a dur value of 1s, an end value of 2s,
        a repeatCount of 7 and a 5s min attribute. The active duration resulting from dur, end and repeatCount
        would be 2s. Because this is less than the min value (2s &lt; 5s)
        the (min constrained) active duration has to be corrected to 5s.
      
      
        On the sixth row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a dur value of 1s, an end
        value of 2s, a repeatCount of 5 and a 8s min attribute value.
        The active duration resulting from dur, end and repeatCount
        would be 2s, because this is less than the min value (2s &lt; 8s)
        the active duration has to be corrected to 8s. As the
        fill attribute is set to 'remove' on the &lt;set&gt; animation, this
        remove is applied at 5s, the end of the repeatCount.
        Note, that if the end of active duration would have been used as a
        syncbase-value for another animation, the corrected end event at
        (begin + min) = 8s has to be used.
      
      
        On the seventh row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a dur value of 1s, an end
        value of 2s, a repeatCount of 5 and a 8s min attribute value.
        The active duration resulting from dur, end and repeatCount
        would be 2s, because this is less than the min value (2s &lt; 8s)
        the active duration has to be corrected to 8s. As the fill attribute
        is set to 'freeze' on the &lt;set&gt; animation, the animation is frozen at
        5s, the end of the repeatCount, the &lt;set&gt; applies indefinitely.
        Note, that if the end of active duration would have been used as a
        syncbase-value for another animation, the corrected end event at
        (begin + min) = 8s has to be used.

        This tests performs basic tests on the max attribute and on
        combinations of the min and max attributes. The test is based
        on the SMIL specification at:
        http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil-timing.html#Timing-MinMax.
      
      
        Each row in the test shows different rectangles subject to &lt;set&gt;
        animations with different configurations with regards to the max and min
        attributes. For each row, the animation should be active
        during the first 5 seconds of the animations where the red rectangle
        should show in the right column. At five seconds into the animation,
        all the rectangles should move to their left position.
      
      
        On the first row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s) active duration
        and no max attribute so the actual active duration is (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
        The first row shows a second rectangle with a &lt;set&gt; animation with
        the same configuration except that the max attribute value is set to
        'media'. Because the &lt;set&gt; element does not define a media, the
        behavior should be as if the attribute was not specified.
      
      
        On the second row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s) active duration
        and a min attribute set to '-6s' for the first rectangle and to 'foo' for the
        second one. These values are invalid for max and, as
        per the specification, the behavior should be as if the attribute was not
        specified. Consequently, the behavior is as for the previous row and
        the actual active duration is (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
      
      
        On the third row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a (0s &lt;= t &lt; 8s) initial active duration
        and a max attribute set to '5s'. The max value is less than the active
        duration, so the max attribute constrains the active duration to (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
      
      
        On the fourth row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s) initial active duration,
        an indefinite simple duration (dur is set to indefinite) and a max attribute set to '8s'.
        Because the initial active duration is less than the max attribute the active
        duration is not constrained and is unchanged at (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
      
      
        On the fifth row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a (0s &lt;= t &lt; indefinite) initial active duration,
        a min of 2s and a max of 5s. Because the min value is less than the max value, both apply
        and the computed active duration is (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
      
      
        On the sixth row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a (0s &lt;= t &lt; indefinite) initial active duration,
        a min of 5s and a max of 5s. Because the min value is equal to the max value, both apply
        and the computed active duration is (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
      
      
        On the seventh row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a [0s, 5s[[ initial active duration,
        a min of 8s and a max of 2s. Because the min value is greater than the max value, both are
        ignored and the computed active duration is [0s, 5s[.

        attribute. For each row, the animation should be active
        during the first 5 seconds of the animations where the red rectangle

        '0s;1s' and a dur attribute set to 4s. This should result in a first
        interval of (0s &lt;= t &lt; 4s) which should be superceeded, at 1s, by a new interval
        of (1s &lt;= t &lt; 5s) because the default restart behavior is 'always'.
        Consequently, the rectangle should be in the right position during the
        (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s) interval and move to the left position at 5s.
      
      
        On the second row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a begin attribute set to
        '0s;1s', a dur attribute set to 4s and a restart attribute set to always.
        The behavior should be the same as for the first row.
      
      
        On the third row, the first (left most) rectangle's &lt;set&gt; animation
        has a begin attribute set to '0s;1s', a dur set to 5s and a restart attribute
        set to whenNotActive. Because of the rules for computing intervals, the
        animation's interval is (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s) and is not superseded by a (1s &lt;= t &lt; 6s) interval
        because of the restart value.

        The second (right most) red rectangle's &lt;set&gt; animation has a begin
        attribute set to '0s;2.5s' and a dur attribute set to 2.5s. This results in
        a first interval (0s &lt;= t &lt; 2.5s) which is followed by a (2.5s &lt;= t &lt; 5s) interval. Consequently,
        the rectangle stays on its right position for the first five seconds before it definitively
        moves to the left position.
      
      
        On the fourth row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has a begin attribute set to
        '0s;5s' and a dur attribute set to 5s. This results in a first interval of (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
        Because the restart attribute is set to 'never', the following possible interval,
        (5s &lt;= t &lt; 10s) does not apply and the animation is only active for the first 5 seconds.
      
      
        The fifth row shows a simple animated red rectangle which lasts for 5 seconds. It shows
        a reference of how the other animations should behave visually: all red rectangles should
        have the same horizontal position as the one on the reference row, at any time during the
        animation.

        This tests performs basic tests on the repeatCount attribute.
      
      
        Each row in the test shows different rectangles subject to &lt;set&gt;
        animations with different configurations with regards to the repeatCount
        attribute. For each row, the animation should be active
        during the first 5 seconds of the animations where the red rectangle
        should show in the right column. At five seconds into the animation,
        all the rectangles should move to their left position.
      
      
        On the first row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur attribute set to
        '5s' and its repeatCount unspecified. Consequently, its only interval
        is (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
      
      
        On the second row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur attribute set to
        1s and its repeatCount set to 5. Consequently, its only interval is
        (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s (1s*5)).
      
      
        On the third row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur attribute set to
        10s and its repeatCount set to 0.5. Consequently, its only interval is
        (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s (10s*0.5))
      
      
        On the fourth row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur attribute set to
        1s and its repeatCount set to indefinite. It also has an end attribute
        set to 5s. Consequently, the repeat duration is indefinite, but the active
        duration is limited by the end attribute and the active interval is (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).

        This tests performs basic tests on the repeatDur attribute.
      
      
        Each row in the test shows different rectangles subject to &lt;set&gt;
        animations with different configurations with regards to the repeatDur
        attribute. For each row, the animation should be active
        during the first 5 seconds of the animations where the red rectangle
        should show in the right column. At five seconds into the animation,
        all the rectangles should move to their left position.
      
      
        On the first row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur attribute set to
        '5s' and its repeatDur unspecified. Consequently, its only interval
        is (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
      
      
        On the second row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur attribute set to
        1s and its repeatDur set to 5s. Consequently, its only interval is
        (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
      
      
        On the third row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur attribute set to
        0.5s and its repeatDur set to 5s. Consequently, its only interval is
        (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
      
      
        On the fourth row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur attribute set to
        1s and its repeatDur set to indefinite. It also has an end attribute
        set to 5s. Consequently, the repeat duration is indefinite, but the active
        duration is limited by the end attribute and the active interval is (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s).
      
      
        On the fifth row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur attribute set to
        0.7s and its repeatDur set to 5s. Consequently, its only interval is
        (0s &lt;= t &lt; 5s). The difference with the 3rd row is that there is a fractional
        number of simple durations in the active duration (7.1428) where there
        is a whole number of simple durations in the third row (10).

        This tests the animation's SMIL fill attribute.
      
      
        On the first row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur
        attribute set to '1s' and its begin attribute set to '0s;
        firstSet.end + 1s'. The fill attribute is unspecified, so
        the effect is as if it was set to 'remove', because 'remove' is
        the default value for fill.

        Consequently, the first interval is (0s &lt;= t &lt; 1s), the second is
        (2s &lt;= t &lt; 3s), the third, (4s &lt;= t &lt; 5s) etc.. The red rectangle starts on the
        right position, moves to the left position for one second, moves
        to the right for 1 second, and so on.
      
      
        On the second row, the &lt;set&gt; animation
        with the identifier 'firstSet' has its dur attribute
        set to 1s and its begin attribute set to '0s; firstSet.end'. The fill attribute
        is set to 'remove'. The behavior should be exactly the same as for the previous
        row, and the rectangle moves from the right position to the left position
        every second.
      
      
        On the third row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur attribute set to
        1s and its begin attribute set to '0s; firstSet.end'. The fill attribute
        is set to 'freeze'. The first interval should be (0s &lt;= t &lt; 1s), the second (2s &lt;= t &lt; 3s),
        the third, (4s &lt;= t &lt; 5s), etc. Between interval, the fill behavior should be applied,
        so the red rectangle should stay on the right position and never go to the
        left position.
      
      
        On the fourth row, the &lt;set&gt; animation has its dur  attribute set to
        1s and its begin attribute set to '0s'. The fill attribute
        is set to 'freeze'. The first interval should be (0s &lt;= t &lt; 1s) and there is no
        following interval. Because of the fill behavior, the &lt;set&gt; should
        apply the last (and only) animation value after 1s. Consequently, the
        red rectangle should stay on the right position and never go to the
        left position.

        Tests the inheritance of animated values on text.
      
      
        This test demonstrates how &lt;set&gt; elements change
        text properties on a &lt;text&gt; element. For
        each of the text properties being tested, 3
        &lt;set&gt; elements are set. The first &lt;set&gt;
        element acts directly on the &lt;text&gt; element. The
        second &lt;set&gt; element acts on a &lt;g&gt; containing
        children. The third &lt;set&gt; element acts on an &lt;a&gt;
        containing children. In each case the test validates that
        the animated value set on the &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt;
        elements is inherited by the &lt;text&gt; element.
        All the &lt;set&gt; elements have a begin attribute
        set to 0s with an offset of 1s after end.
        So, the animation will apply 1s after the document is loaded
        and will repeat every 1s after the animation ends.
      
      
        The first &lt;set&gt; validates the transform property. When
        applied to the &lt;text&gt; element, the letter A will be
        translated to the right every 1s, in the &lt;text&gt; column.
        When applied to the &lt;g&gt; element, the letter A inherits the
        transform value and is translated to the right every 1s, as
        seen in the &lt;g&gt; column. When applied to the &lt;a&gt;
        element, the letter A inherits the transform value and is
        translated to the right every 1s, as seen in &lt;a&gt; column.
      
      
        The second &lt;set&gt; validates the text-anchor attribute.
        When applied to the &lt;text&gt; element, the anchor position
        of letter A is moved from start to end. When applied to the
        &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt; element, the property is inherited
        and hence the anchor position of letter A is moved from start
        to end in the second row.
      
      
        The third &lt;set&gt; validates the font-size attribute.
        The font size of letter A is changed from 20 to 30.
        When applied to &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt; elements, the letter
        A inherits the font-size and hence in row 3, letter A has a
        font-size of 30 in all 3 right columns of row 3.
      
      
        The fourth &lt;set&gt; validates the font-family attribute.
        The font-family is changed from default to serif.
        When applied to &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt; elements, the letter
        A inherits the font-family attribute and hence in row 4,
        letter A has serif font-family in all 3 columns.
      
      
        The fifth &lt;set&gt; validates the font-style attribute.
        The font-style is changed from normal to italic.
        When applied to &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt; elements, the letter
        A inherits the font-style attribute and hence in row 5,
        letter A is animated to italic in all 3 columns.
      
      
        The sixth &lt;set&gt; validates the font-weight attribute.
        The font-weight is changed from normal to bold.
        When applied to &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt; elements, the letter
        A inherits the font-weight attribute and hence in row 6,
        letter A is changed to bold on the right.

        This test demonstrates how &lt;set&gt; elements change
        graphics properties on elements from the 'Basic Shapes' chapter. For
        each of the graphics properties being tested, 3
        &lt;set&gt; elements are set. The first &lt;set&gt;
        element acts directly on the 'Basic Shape' element. The
        &lt;set&gt; element acts on a &lt;g&gt; containing
        children. The third &lt;set&gt; element acts on an &lt;a&gt;
        containing children. In each case the test validates that
        the animated value set on the &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt;
        elements is inherited by the 'Basic Shape' element.
        All the &lt;set&gt; elements have a begin attribute
        set to 0s with an offset of 1s after end.
        So, the animation will apply 1s after the document is loaded
        and will repeat every 1s after the animation ends.
      
      
        The first &lt;set&gt; validates the fill property, with
        fill set to orange. When applied directly to the 'Basic Shape'
        element, the &lt;rect&gt; fill value will change to orange
        when it is translated to the right every 1s. When applied
        to the &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt; elements, the &lt;rect&gt;
        inherits the fill value and is orange.
      
      
        The second &lt;set&gt; validates the fill-style property,
        with fill-style set to evenodd. When applied to the
        'Basic Shape' element, the &lt;polyline&gt; fill-style is
        changed from nonzero to evenodd. When applied to the
        &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt; elements, the &lt;polyline&gt; inherits
        the evenodd fill-style.
      
      
        the third &lt;set&gt; validates the stroke property.
        In this case fill is set to none. When stroke is applied
        to the 'Basic Shape' element, the &lt;rect&gt; on the right
        appears with the stroke color. When applied to the &lt;g&gt; and
        &lt;a&gt; elements, the &lt;rect&gt; inherits the stroke property.
      
      
        the fourth &lt;set&gt; validates the stroke-width property,
        with stroke-width set to 4. When stroke-width is applied
        to the 'Basic Shape' element, the &lt;line&gt; on the right
        has a width of 4. When applied to the &lt;g&gt; and
        &lt;a&gt; elements, the &lt;line&gt; inherits the stroke-width.
      
      
        the fifth &lt;set&gt; validates the stroke-linecap property,
        with stroke-linecap set to round. When stroke-linecap is applied
        to the 'Basic Shape' element, the &lt;line&gt; stroke-linecap
        value switches from butt to round. When applied to the &lt;g&gt;
        and &lt;a&gt; elements, the &lt;line&gt; inherits the
        square stroke-linecap.
      
      
        the sixth &lt;set&gt; validates the stroke-linejoin property,
        with stroke-linejoin set to bevel. When stroke-linejoin is applied
        to the 'Basic Shape' element, the &lt;line&gt; stroke-linejoin
        value switches from miter to bevel. When applied to the &lt;g&gt;
        and &lt;a&gt; elements, the &lt;line&gt; inherits the
        bevel stroke-linejoin.
      
      
        the seventh &lt;set&gt; validates the stroke-miterlimit property,
        with stroke-miterlimit set to 10. When stroke-miterlimit
        is applied to the 'Basic Shape' element, the miter-length to
        stroke-width ratio exceeds the miter-limit and the
        &lt;polyline&gt; switches from bevel to miter.When applied
        to the &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt; elements,the &lt;line&gt;
        inherits the stroke-miterlimit.
      
      
        the eighth &lt;set&gt; validates the stroke-dashoffset property,
        with stroke-dashoffset set to 5.5. When stroke-dashoffset is applied
        to the 'Basic Shape' element, the &lt;line&gt; has a different
        dashing pattern. When applied to the &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt;
        elements, the &lt;line&gt; inherits the property.
      
      
        the ninth &lt;set&gt; validates the display property,
        with display set to none. When display is applied
        to the 'Basic Shape' element, the &lt;rect&gt; does not
        appear on the right. When applied to the &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt;
        elements, the &lt;line&gt; inherits the display property and
        hence is not seen.
      
      
        the tenth &lt;set&gt; validates the visibility property,
        with visibility set to hidden. When visibility is applied
        to the 'Basic Shape' element, the &lt;rect&gt; is hidden
        on the right. When applied to the &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt;
        elements, the &lt;line&gt; inherits the visibility property
        and hence is not seen.
      
      
        the eleventh &lt;set&gt; validates the color property,
        with color set to blue. When color is applied to the
        'Basic Shape' element, the &lt;rect&gt; on the right
        switches from default color of black to blue. When
        applied to the &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt;
        elements, the &lt;line&gt; inherits the color property.
      
      
        The eleventh &lt;set&gt; validates the color property, with
        color set to orange. When applied directly to the 'Basic Shape'
        element, the &lt;rect&gt; fill value will change to orange
        when it is translated to the right every 1s. When applied
        to the &lt;g&gt; and &lt;a&gt; elements, the &lt;rect&gt;
        inherits the color value, and via its fill="currentColor"
        becomes orange.

        This test demonstrates validates the operation of the
        animateTransform element and validates the operation
        of the different type attribute values.
      
      
        There are 5 possible values for the type attribute and
        there is one animateTransform for each type and two for
        the translate type.
      
      
        For each transform type, the test has a corresponding animateTransform.
        The test uses references to show what the expected transform should be
        at different points in the animation. For example, the top left
        animateTransform, for type=rotate, shows circular markers which turn
        orange at the time of corresponding transform value should be set by the
        animateTransform.
        The marker elements show the expected transform value on reference
        markers in the test.

        This test tests the operation of the animateTransform's
        additive behavior.
      
      
        The first two rectangles, on the top row, show the effect of the
        additive attribute on animateTransform. The left-most
        animateTransforms have their additive attribute set to replace,
        so the effect of the two transform animation is as if only the
        highest priority one applied because it replaces the underlying
        value. The second animateTransforms (from left to right) have
        their additive attribute set to sum, which means the transforms
        they produce are concatenated.
      
      
        The last two rectangles, on the top row, show the effect of the
        accumulate attribute on animateTransform. For the left one
        (third on the row, from left to right), the accumulate attribute
        is set to none. There are two repeats for the
        animateTransform. Therefore, the transform goes twice from a
        scale(1,1) to a scale(2,2). For the right-most animateTransform,
        the accumulate attribute is set to sum. There are two repeats
        and the animation goes from scale(0,0) to scale(2,2) for the
        first iteration and then from scale(2,2) to scale(4,4) (because
        the result of the second iteration is added to the
        scale(2,2) result of the previous, first iteration).
      
      
        The rectangles on the bottom row show the combination of
        additive and cumulative behavior. The left rectangle's
        animateTransform accumulate behavior is set to none but its
        additive behavior is set to sum. Therefore, the transform's
        underlying value (skewX(30)) is always pre-concatenated to the
        animateTransform's result, which goes from "skewX(30)
        scale(1,1)" to "skewX(30) scale(2,2)" in each of its two
        iterations.  The right rectangle's animateTransform accumulate
        behavior is set to sum and the additive behavior is also set to
        sum. Therefore, the transform's underlying value is always
        pre-concatenated, and repetitions of the scale animation
        get added together. Consequently, the transform goes from "skewX(30)
        scale(0,0)" to "skewX(30) scale(2,2)" for the first iteration
        and then from "skewX(30) scale(2,2)" to "skewX(30)
        scale(4,4)" for the second iteration.

        This test demonstrates validates the operation of
        animateTransform with regards to the rotation center
        and with regards to paced animation.
      
      
        The following descriptions describe the various animations,
        going top bottom, left to right. For each animation, orange
        rectangle markers show the expected position for the animated rectangle
        halfway through the animation. The markers are drawn with a thick
        stroke for 0.2s, starting at the time when they reflect the
        expected position.
      
      
        The first animateTransform has type='rotate' and goes from
        45 degrees to 90 degrees over a period of 3s. The rotation
        center for the from and to values is 0, 0. At 0 seconds, the
        expected transform should be rotate(45). At 1.5 seconds, the
        expected transform is rotate(0.5 * (90 + 45)) = rotate(67.5).
        At 3s, the expected transform is rotate(90).
      
      
        The second animateTransform has type='rotate' but has a
        rotation center that varies between the from and to values.
        The rotation goes from rotate(45,0,0) to rotate(90,-15,-15).
        At 0s, the expected transform is rotate(45,0,0).
        At 1.5s, the expected transform is rotate(67.5, -7.5, -7.5).
        At 3s, the expected transform is rotate(90, -15, -15).
      
      
        The third animateTransform has type='translate' and calcMode='paced'.
        The animation goes from translate(-40,40) to translate(-20,20) to
        translate(40,-40).
        At 0s, the expected transform is translate(-40,40).
        At 1.5s, the expected transform is translate(0,0).
        At 3s, the expected transform is translate(40,-40).
      
      
        The fourth animateTransform has type='translate' and calcMode='linear'.
        The animation goes from translate(-40,40) to translate(-20,-20) to
        translate(40,-40).
        At 0s, the expected transform is translate(-40,40).
        At 1.5s, the expected transform is translate(-20,-20).
        At 3s, the expected transform is translate(40,-40).
      
      
        The fifth animateTransform has type='scale' and calcMode='paced'.
        The animation goes from scale(1,2) to scale(3,2) to
        scale(1,1).
        At 0s, the expected transform is scale(1,2).
        At 1.5s, the expected transform is scale(3,2).
        At 3s, the expected transform is scale(1,1).
      
      
        The sixth animateTransform has type='scale' and calcMode='linear'.
        The animation goes from scale(1,2) to scale(3,2) to
        scale(1,1).
        At 0s, the expected transform is scale(1,2).
        At 1.5s, the expected transform is scale(3,2).
        At 3s, the expected transform is scale(1,1).
      
      
        The seventh animateTransform has type="rotate" and calcMode='paced'.
        The animation goes from rotate(0,0,0) to rotate(45,-15,-20) to
        rotate(180,30,50). The total length along the rotation angle component
        is (45 - 0) + (180 - 45) = 180. The total length along the rotation
        center along the x axis is (0 - (-15)) + (30 - (-15)) = 45 + 15 = 60.
        The total length along the rotation center along the y axis is
        (0 - (-20)) + (50 - (-20)) = 20 + 70 = 90.
        At 0s, the expected transform is rotate(45,-15,-20).
        At 1.5s, the expected transform is rotate(90,0,5) to achieve constant
        velocity along the rotation angle component, the x-axis rotation center
        component and the y-axis rotation center component. At 1.5s, half the
        distance has been run on each component. For the rotation angle, this
        means that 45 has been reached and that 45 more degrees in the (45 &lt;= r &lt; 180)
        interval have been consumed. For the x-axis rotation center, this means
        that 30 units have been run: the (0 &gt;= x &gt; -15) interval has been fully consumed
        (15 units long) and 15 units on the (-15 &lt;= x &lt; 30) interval have been consumed,
        which explains the computed 0 value. For the y-axis rotation center, this
        means that 45 units have been run: the (0 &gt;= y &gt; -20) interval has been fully
        consumed and 25 units have been consumed in the (-20 &lt;= y &lt; 50) interval, which
        explains the computed 5 value.
        At 3s, the expected transform is rotate(180,30,50).

        This test validates the operation of the animate element
        on the &lt;path&gt; element's d attribute.
      
      
        The following descriptions references to the tests by number. The first test
        is the one showing on the top left. The last, sixth test is the one showing
        at the bottom right. Test numbers are alocated from left to right and from
        top to bottom.

        For each test, there are reference outline markers which show the expected
        animated shape at different times in the animation. At the time of the expected
        shape, the outline of the expected shape is drawn with a thick stroke for 0.2s
        so the test user can visually check that the shapes are matching at the
        expected times.
      
      
        The first test validates a simple from-to animation on a path's d attribute
        made of M, C and Z commands where both the from and to attributes are specified.
        The attributes are compatible with the path element's d attribute.
      
      
        The second test validates a simple to-animation on a path's d attribute
        made of M, C and Z commands where the to attribute is specified.
        The attribute is compatible with the path element's d attribute.
      
      
        The third test validates a simple values-animation on a path's d attribute
        made of M, C and Z commands where the values attribute is specified and
        specifies three seperate values.
        The attribute is compatible with the path element's d attribute.
      
      
        The fourth, fifth and sixth tests validate that interpolation between compatible
        path values (i.e., path values which normalize to the compatible values) is
        supported.
      
      
        The fourth tests interpolation between a path value containing H, V and L commands
        (in the from value) and a path value containing compatible h, v and l commands
        (in the to value).
      
      
        The fifth tests interpolation between a path value containing C and S commands
        (in the from value) and a path value containing compatible c and s commands
        (in the to value).
      
      
        The sixth tests interpolation between a path value containing Q, T and A commands
        (in the from value) and a path value containing compatible q, t and a commands
        (in the to value).

          This tests that the underlying value of a scale transformation
          is 0.  Since SMIL defines a by animation as being equivalent
          to an additive values animation where the first value is zero and
          the second value is the by value, such an animation would
          begin by post-multiplying a scale(0) transformation to
          the element's underlying transform list.

          Tests if the color datatype is supported. There are multiple syntaxes for
        specifying the same color, such as #37F and #3377FF.
For each of the six groups shown here,
        each of the circles in the group uses one of the syntactical forms 
        
 
        The first row uses five forms - 3-digit hex, 6-digit hex, rbg() integer form, rgb() percentage form,
        and the 'HTML' subset of the name ('X11') colors.
      
      
        The second row uses only four forms - 3-digit hex, 6-digit hex, rbg() integer form, rgb() percentage form -
        as there are no HTML or X11 names for those colors.

        This is illustrated using a single rectangle that is a child of a group
        element. A fill is specified for the group element but not the
        rectangle. Colour is specifed for the rectangle and the group element.

        This test checks that namespace prefixes are handled correctly.
      
      
        First, a random 20-character string is generated. The string only contains characters that are valid NCName letters.
        This string is then used as a custom prefix for an 'href' attribute in the XLink namespace.
        An 'image' element is created and two image references are added, one is in the "http://www.this.is.not.an/xlink" namespace,
        and one is in the XLink namespace. Only the attribute with the 20-character prefix is actually in the XLink namespace,
        which means that that link should be the one that is used when rendering the 'image' element. This first subtest is
        using the setAttributeNS method.

        Verify the conversion processing of percentage and fraction values relative to
        object bounding boxes. This is used when defining linear and radial gradients
        as well as patterns.
      
      
        The test validates conversion for coordinates, width, height and length. The first
        test defines three corresponding linear gradients, which specify coordinates
        using percentages for one, fractions for the second and user coordinates for the
        third. The second test defines three corresponding radial gradients, which specify
        a length (radius) using percentages for the first, fractions for the second and
        user space for the third. Finally, the third test defines three corresponding patterns,
        which specify their width and height using percentages for the first, fractions for the
        second and user space coordinates for the last one.
      
      
        The test also assumes that linear and radial gradients,
        as well as patterns are implemented.

        Verify the conversion processing of CSS units and percentage values for both

        in all pixel resolutions. Hence, the conversion from other CSS units to CSS px is
        left out of the test.
      
      
        There are six atomic tests in this test. For each, the approach is to draw two similar
        elements (circles or rects) with coordinates specified in user space for one and in
        CSS units or percentage for the other. Each test is such that these two values (or
        value pairs) should match.

        This test verifies both the initial viewport size and the support for the various
        unit specifiers.
      
      
        The units in SVG can be: user coordinate and CSS units: em, ex, px, pt, pc, cm, mm,
        in and percentages. The test does not check the absolute length accuracy as this
        can only be truly validated with a ruler. However, it validates that the different
        units are supported by drawing multiple elements who have the same length specified
        in different units.
      
      
        The viewport is the "finite rectangular region" where rendering occurs in SVG.
        Hence, nothing should be rendered outside the viewport (paragraph 7.1). Furthermore,
        when no positioning properties are set on the top svg element, the initial viewport
        size should have the value of the top svg element's "width" and "height" attributes.
        To check this behavior, the test does not define positioning properties on the top
        svg element but defines its "width" and "height" properties. Then it fills a red
        rectangle that is bigger than the viewport size. Then, a rectangle, the size of the
        viewport is drawn in white. If rendering is limited to the viewport area, none of the
        red should show.
      
      
        The line showing the "ex" units will not necessarily appear with the same length
        as shown in the reference image because the X-height of a font is not
        necessarily half of the font size (which is assumed in the reference image where
        1ex is considered to be .5em).

        Test background image processing.
      
      
        The first subtest enables background image processing and adds an empty ‘g’ element 
        which invokes the ShiftBGAndBlur filter. This filter takes the current accumulated 
        background image (i.e., the entire reference graphic) as input, shifts its offscreen 
        down, blurs it, and then writes the result to the canvas. Note that the offscreen for
        the filter is initialized to transparent black, which allows the already rendered 
        rectangle, circle and triangle to show through after the filter renders its own 
        result to the canvas.
      
      
        The second subtest enables background image processing and instead invokes the 
        ShiftBGAndBlur filter on the inner ‘g’ element. The accumulated background at the 
        time the filter is applied contains only the rectangle. Because the children 
        of the inner ‘g’ (i.e., the circle and triangle) are not part of the inner ‘g’ element's 
        background and because ShiftBGAndBlur ignores SourceGraphic, the children of the inner ‘g’
        do not appear in the result.
      
      
        The third subtest enables background image processing and invokes the ShiftBGAndBlur on the 
        ‘polygon’ element that draws the triangle. The accumulated background at the time the filter 
        is applied contains the rectangle plus the circle ignoring the effect of the ‘opacity’ 
        property on the inner ‘g’ element. (Note that the blurred circle at the bottom does not 
        let the rectangle show through on its left side. This is due to ignoring the effect of 
        the ‘opacity’ property.) Because the triangle itself is not part of the accumulated background 
        and because ShiftBGAndBlur ignores SourceGraphic, the triangle does not appear in the result.
      
      
        The fourth subtest is the same as the third except that filter ShiftBGAndBlur_WithSourceGraphic is 
        invoked instead of ShiftBGAndBlur. ShiftBGAndBlur_WithSourceGraphic performs the same effect as 
        ShiftBGAndBlur, but then renders the SourceGraphic on top of the shifted, blurred background 
        image. In this case, SourceGraphic is the blue triangle; thus, the result is the same as in 
        the fourth case except that the triangle now appears.

        Tests the default behaviour of feComponentTransfer
      
      
        The test displays two rects with the same gradient fill. The gradient
        fill has the stops red, green, blue and black all of which are evenly
        spaced.
      
      
        The first rect with the 'Reference' label beneath it has an
        feComponentTransfer filter applied to it. This filter specifies a
        'linear' transform for the Red component such that Red is transformed to
        Black. The Green component is specified as an 'identity' transform. The
        remaining components (Green, Alpha) are unspecified and by default
        must be treated as 'identity' transforms.
      
      
        The second rect with the 'Default' label beneath it has an
        feComponentTransfer filter applied to it. This filter specifies a
        multiple transforms from the Red component. The last transform
        specified for the Red component is a 'linear' transform that shifts Red
        to Black. This is the transform that should be used by a conforming
        implementation. There are no other components specified for the filter
        of the second rect. A conforming implementation should treat
        unspecified components in an feComponentTransfer as 'identity'.

        node.  Six images should appear in 2 rows of 3.  On the left in each
        row a test image of a checker board is displayed.  In the middle
        column is the displacement map.  In the right-hand column is the
        result.  All displacement maps are generated as png files with gamma
        1.0 and must be interpreted linearly for the proper geometric
        displacement to occur.
      
      
        The top row tests a displacement map which displaces each pixel by an
        amount equivalent to a rotation of 20 degrees around the center of the
        image.  A blue reference rectangle is drawn on the result using an svg
        transform attribute to mimick the same 20 degree rotation.  The edges
        of the blue rectangle should be parallel to the grid lines in the
        displaced image.  Distortion of the grid pattern such that the grid
        lines are slightly curved is indicative of improper gamma handling in
        the viewer.
      
      
        The bottom row tests a displacement map which distorts the image
        spherically.

        'rect' elements.  Figure labeling uses the text element.  The

        Filters are applied to three of the red circles, hiding them and showing the green circle.

        Thus, a null filter is applied and the red circle is not shown, allowing the green circle to be seen.
      
      
        The bottom left subtest applies an empty filter element with the default filterRegion, and the bottom right 
        subtest applies an empty filter with a non-default filterRegion. In both cases where empty filters are applied,

        In the upper left corner of the output are blue and yellow rectangles that overlap,
        they appear normally, no gaussianBlur has been applied.
        In the upper right the same rectangles are displayed with a blur filter applied,
        the standard deviation is the same for both the x and y axis.
        In the lower right corner the rectangles appear again,
        this time the standard deviation is different along the x (20) and y (1) axis.
      
      
        On top of the rectangles in the upper right and lower right, thin (half-pixel-wide) blue
        lines are drawn to show the outline of the object bounding box (the inside lines) and the
        outline of the filter region (the outside lines). The blur effect should be clipped
        to the bounds of the filter region.
      
      
        The test uses the 'rect' element, as well as basic fill (solid primary colors),
        stroke (black 1-pixel and blue half-pixel lines), font-family (Arial) and font-size properties.

          The test shows four different elevation angles that can be used for feDistantLight source.
          The four different feDistantLight light sources are used in three different filter cases; feDiffuseLight, feSpecularLight
          and feMerge which merges both feDiffuseLight and feSpecularLight to form a single filter. Using four different elevation values
          in three different filter cases gives twelve different filters. All twelve filter cases are applied to a vector graphic and
          then to a raster graphic. The vector graphic results are shown to the left and the raster graphic results are shown to the right.

        This test validates that the font element's horiz-adv-x is used as
        the default glyph's advance when there is no glyph advance specified.
        All fonts have a units-per-em of 1000.
      
      
        The first row shows a layout with a default advance of 1000.
        Glyphs have no advance so the 1000 default should be used.
      
      
        The second row shows a layout with a default advance of 2000.
        Glyphs have no advance so the 2000 default should be used.
      
      
        The last row shows a layout with a default advance of 0.
        Glyphs have a specified advance so the 0 default should be ignored.
      
      
        Blue reference markers show the expected glyph positions.

        This is a basic test for embedded SVG fonts. The font "Comic Sans"
        (available from Microsoft) has been converted into an SVG font and embedded
        in the SVG file. The test contains two text areas, each with the character
        string "AyÖ@ç" drawn at the same font size.
      
      
        The upper area contains the glyphs from the embedded font placed in
        the SVG file as path elements. Each glyph is placed at the location it
        would be if rendered using normal text rendering (ie. the horizontal
        advance between characters has been preserved).
      
      
        The lower area contains the text string rendered using the embedded
        SVG font, referenced with a CSS @font-face declaration. The SVG font does not have a font-family attribute, so the reference is via the @font-face block which points to a font element by ID. It should appear
        exactly the same as the upper text area,
        ie. font size, character baseline and horizontal advance should be
        the same.

    	ISSUE: http://www.w3.org/2011/02/27-svg-irc#T22-20-51 - unapprove test for now
      
        This files tests the lang attribute support of the glyph
        element. The test should produce an upward-triangle for
        the first (en) test element and a square for the second (fr)
        and third (fr-ca)  text element. In the third case, a glyph for
        fr is also suitable for a more specific language text fr-ca.
        In the fourth case, no suitable language specific or general
        glyph is provided by the test so a fallback font for the letter
        'a' should be used. A triangle or square must not be
        displayed in the fourth case.

          Verify basic support for DOM event listener registration. The root svg element
          has an onload handler where a click event listener is registered on group element 'Start Button'.
        
      
        If UI events listener registration is supported (and UI events),
        when the user clicks on the button a text node is inserted reading "Event Listeners supported".
      
      
        At the end of the test, the start test button is changed to green,
        and the click event listener is removed from the the start button.
      
      
        Subsequent clicks on the start button should cause no effect if
        the event listener has been removed successfully.
        If additional lines of text appear in the document that say "Event Listeners supported",
        then the implementation has not successfully removed the event listener.

        Test 'onload' event attribute.
      
      
        Six blue rectangles have been defined, each initially defined with
        'visibility:hidden'. 'onload' event attributes are assigned in
        a variety of ways, usually to set 'visibility:visible'.
        The red text indicates the correct behavior
        (whether a given rectangle should appear in the visual result).
      
      
        The first rectangle has no associated 'onload' event so it remains invisible.
        The second rectangle has an 'onload' event on itself, which invokes a script
        which sets 'visibility:visible', so it should appear.
        The third rectangle has an 'onload' event on its parent 'g', which invokes a script
        which sets 'visibility:visible' on the rectangle, so it should appear.
        The fourth rectangle has an 'onload' event on an ancestor 'svg', which invokes a script
        which sets 'visibility:visible' on the rectangle, so it should appear.
        The fifth rectangle has an 'onload' event both itself and its parent 'g'.
        The rectangle's script sets 'visibility:visible' on the rectangle
        but the parent's script sets  'visibility:hidden' on the rectangle,
        which should happen afterwards, so the rectangle should not appear.
        The sixth rectangle has an 'onload' event on the outermost 'svg', which invokes a script
        which sets 'visibility:visible' on the rectangle, so it should appear.

        This test tests 'pointer-events' on text. Initially you should see four big rects with black stroke.
        In the uppermost rect there should be 10 'O':s with black fill.
        In the second rect from the top there should be 10 'O':s with no fill but with black stroke.
        In the third and fourth rects there should be no visible 'O':s at all.
        In the fourth rect there should be two green rects, and in each of the other three rects there should be one green rect.
      
      
        For UA debugging purposes it's possible to click the "Toggle freeze" button before running the test.
        That will reset the visibility, fill and stroke on each 'O' as the cursor moves over them so that it's
        possible to trigger the change more than once. If the "Toggle freeze" button is clicked once again that
        means the change will remain after the cursor moves out.

        This is the first of a set of three tests that verify the capability to
        handle links into SVG content, using
        each of the three fragment identifier forms permissible in SVG.
      
      
        There is a colored arrow comprising the content of an 'a' element.  The
        link destination is in an auxiliary file, linkingCircle-f.svg, and
        is expressed by xlink:href="linkingCircle-f.svg#fragmentValue".
        The initial view of this test contains one pale blue arrow plus labelling text.
      
      
        The (blue) arrow uses the "bare name" fragment identifier
        form, "#circle-2", to target the circle with id "circle-2" in the external
        file.

        of three colored arrows comprise the content of an 'a' element.  The

        There are several reference images associated with this test case.  The first
        illustrates the correct "start" or initial state of the rendered SVG file.
        The second illustrates the correct image after the first link is activated

        provide access to multiple PNGs; the first, initial-state PNG is shown.)
      
      
        The test uses the 'rect' and 'polygon' elements, as well as basic fill (solid simple colors),
        stroke (black and colored wide and 1-pixel lines), font-family (Arial) and font-size properties.

        test case are internal, i.e., to 'view' elements in the same SVG file.
      
      
        This test is identical to linking-uri-02-b except that the links there are external.
      
      
        In the four quadrants of the initial picture are four graphical objects.
        Clockwise from upper right, they are
        a purple rectangle, blue ellipse, green polygon (pentagon), and yellow
        circle.  Each is labelled and tightly boxes with a rectangular frame.
        These are identical to their counterparts in linking-uri-01-b.svg, in which
        file each has an associated 'view' element, with attributes
        per the labels in the initial picture.
      
      
        In the center is a gray box with four lines of text, each of which says
        "Go to" followed by Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, and Circle, respectively.
        Each of these is contained within an 'a' element, whose xlink:href names
        the respective 'view' element of the respective graphical object.

        illustrates the correct initial state of the rendered SVG file, which should
        also be the correct picture after the Rectangle link is executed.

        of the rectangle from 1.0 (at the top) to 0.5 (at the bottom).
      
      
        In the second test, a simple 50% opaque rectangle is used as a mask.
      
      
        In the third test, no mask is used, but a rectangle is shown with 50% opacity.
        The second and third test should look the same.
      
      
        Lastly, a string of text has a mask applied to it. The mask only covers a partial
        area of the text, so the text should only be half visible. Also the mask consists

        Test 'overflow'/'clip' on outermost and inner 'svg' elements.
      
      
        There are two parts to the test. The first part tests viewport clipping
        on outermost 'svg' elements. The second part tests viewport clipping
        on inner 'svg' elements.
      
      
        The test case also tests the initial value of the 'overflow' property
        to ensure that it is set to 'hidden' for all 'svg' elements.
        Tester should zoom out and/or pan to check this.
      
      
        To test clipping to the outermost 'svg' element,
        a rectangle with a light blue interior, a light red border and a black
        string that says "Clip to outer 'svg'" is painted four times such that
        it will overflow each of the top, left, right and bottom
        sides of the bounds of the outermost 'svg' element, respectively.
      
      
        To test clipping to inner 'svg' elements, a rectangle with a light red
        interior, a light blue border and a black string that says "Clip to
        inner 'svg'" is painted four times such that it will overflow each of
        the top, left, right and bottom sides of the bounds of an inner 'svg'
        element, respectively.  
      
      
        Note that minor text layout differences, as are permissible under CSS2
        rules, can lead to slightly different visual results regarding where
        the text strings get clipped.

        This test exercises basic user-specified clip paths, using a text
        string (i.e., content of a 'text' element) as the clip path.
      
      
        There is a rectangular image of a swirly blue pattern with large
        yellow text, "Clip Test" superimposed. The image is a PNG file,
        imported into the picture via the 'image' element.
      
      
        The test uses the 'rect' element, as well as basic fill (solid primary
        colors), stroke (black 1-pixel lines), font-family (Arial and
        Impact) and font-size properties.

          This tests that 'clipPath' elements can be used together and how the clipping paths are intersected.
        
      
        There is a gray-white pattern as a background for the two subtest rectangles. This is to show that the holes that are cut out using clip-paths are transparent.
        The first subtest verifies that when you use the 'clip-path' property on a child element inside a 'clipPath' element the child element is clipped correctly.
        The second subtest verifies that when a 'clipPath' element has a 'clip-path' property the result is the intersection of the two clip paths.

          The top test examines the basic support for the marker element and style. The markers are purple rectangles.
        
        
          The middle test examines the support for the different styles of marker properties. The
          "marker-start" property defines the marker to use at the first vertex of the marked path,
          in this case a purple rectangle. The "marker-end" property defines the marker to use at the
          last vertex of the marked path, in this case a blue triangle. The "marker-mid" property
          defines the marker to use at all vertices, other than the first and last, of the marked path,
          in this case a green circle.
        
        
          The bottom test examines the support for marker orientation along the
          path direction. The second vertex, the top right corner of the path, has a marker that
          is rotated 45 degrees, since that is the average of the horizontal and vertical segments
          each side. The last vertex, the bottom right corner of the path, has a marker rotated 90
          degrees since that is the direction of the last path segment.

          Tests the rendering of markers, specifically property inheritance. For the four tests, there should
          be two identical paths with markers drawn. 
        
        
          The top two tests examine the rendering of markers when the marker and the path
          referencing it share the same parent and all painting properties are specfied on
          that parent. The first test show inheritance of the 'fill' property and the
          second the inheritance of the 'paint' property. In both tests, the marker
          is painting using the same properties as the referencing object. Because of
          scaling transformations on the marker, the stroke on the second test is thinner
          than on the referencing object.
        
        
          The third and fourth tests examine the rendering of markers in a situation where the
          marker and referencing path do NOT share the same parent and painting
          properties are specified both on the parent of the marked path and on the contents
          of the marker itself. In both cases, the marker's parent specifies
          fill="green" stroke="blue" stroke-width="8". For the third test, the marker contents
          override with stroke="black". For the fourth test, the marker contents
          override with fill="black". In neither case should you see
          fill="orange" or stroke="blue" or "stroke="purple" on the markers as these properties
          are specified on the ancestor of the referencing object or the referencing object itself
          and thus shouldn't affect the marker.

          is rotated 45 degrees, since that is the average of the horizontal and vertical segments
          each side. The last vertex, the bottom right corner of the path, has a marker rotated 90
          degrees since that is the direction of the last path segment.

        This tests shows the same linear gradient used with different values for the
        color-interpolation rendering property.  The top bar is painted using the
        default color-interpolation value, which should produce the same result as
        sRGB. The middle bar is painted using the 'sRGB' color-interpolation and
        should be the same as the top bar. Finally, the bottom bar is painted using
        the linearRGB interpolation, which produces a result visibly different from
        the top two bars: the white to blue ramp is whiter, the blue to red ramp
        goes through a pinkish color and the red to yellow ramp turns orange before
        the similar sRGB rampl.

        This tests that the 'color-interpolation' property is honored when
        alpha compositing is performed.
      
      
        The test slide consists of seven rectangular regions,
        each of which is filled with either a dark or light
        shade of gray.  The 'color-interpolation' property
        is used on the rectangles to control whether a
        dark or light shade of gray appears.  Text inside each
        rectangular region indicates whether the shade of gray
        should be dark or light.  The top two rectangular regions
        are references against which the remaining five are to
        be compared.

        There are two rectangles. The top one has
        a radial gradient (black to orange) that should appear elliptical
        to fit the aspect ratio of the rectangle. The units are
        specified in objectBoundingBox space. The gradient

        Test that checks the capability of the stop opacity in linear and radial
        gradients.
      
      
        There are two tests which contain rectangles with gradients using stop-opacity properties.
        A cyan color text string "Background" is put behind both of the rectangles to help
        demonstrate the opacity concept.
      
      
        From top-down the appearance of objects is as follows.
      
      
        The first rectangle has a linear gradient fill with a vector starting at top left
        and going to bottom right. The stop colors are at 20% spacing apart and are in the
        following order : violet, blue, lime, yellow, orange, black.
        Also a stop opacity is given to the colors in the following order: 1, 0.2, 0.5, 0, 0.8, 1
        Because the gradient vector vector goes from (0,0) to (1,1) in object bounding box space

        Test that the viewer can handle the gradientTransform and the patternTransform
        attribute on gradients and patterns respectively.
      
      
        From top-down the appearance of objects is as follows.
      
      
        The top rectangle has a linear gradient whose coordinate system has been scaled down by
        a half. So the gradient travelling from left to right (from blue to green to lime) should
        only occuply the left half the rectangle.
      
      
        The next rectangle has radial gradient that has been translated to the center and skewed
        in the positive X direction by 45 degrees. Therefore the gradient should appear
        ellipltical and rotated around the center.
      
      
        The last row contains a rectangle with pattern on the fill. The transformation on the
        pattern moves the coordinate system to the top left of the rectangle and then scales it
        by a factor of 2 and then skew's it in the X direction by 45 degrees. The pattern
        consists of a 2 by 2 array of colored rectangles.

        Test that a 'pattern' element can inherit attributes through multiple levels of
        'xlink:href' referencing.
      
      
        The test defines a pattern 'pattern1' with some attributes that scale the contents. The attributes on
        'pattern1' are inherited into 'pattern2' and then inherited from 'pattern2'
        into 'pattern3'.  'pattern3' has a green circle as its graphical content.
        A 'rect' uses 'pattern3' as its fill, if the attributes are correctly inherited into
        'pattern3', then the green circle will occlude a red circle in the same position.

        incorrectly overridden values from a non-existant pattern. The result is tested
        with a reference pattern using slightly different syntax.

        A subtest that explicitly specifies 'width' and 'height' as 0 is added as a reference.

        The test shows an 'ellipse' element originating at (0,0) of the current user coordinate system, which has been altered via 'transform' from
        the initial user coordinate system. Two perpendicular lines which also originate at (0,0) and advance along the x and y axes of 
        the current user coordinate system are shown. These lines overlap the top and left edges of the ellipse and verifies that the ellipse is 
        thus axis-aligned with its current user coordinate system.

        Six blue 'rect' elements are defined. For each conditional processing attribute, a black 'rect' element is defined with that particular conditional
        processing attribute set to an arbitrary string that would cause the attribute's requirement test to fail. Each of the black 'rect' elements is
        positioned so that it would completely cover the blue 'rect' if it were visible. A corresponding 'use' element is defined for each black 'rect'

          Verify the basic capability to handle the SVG DOM API.
        
      
        The test is composed of a top
        level svg element with an 'onload' event handler and a rect element. Both
        the svg and the rect elements have an identifier. The 'onload' handler
        invokes SVG-specific DOM API methods which use these identifiers.
      
      
        First, the handler gets the SVG element owner of the rect element and checks it has
        the expected identifier. Then, the handler accesses the coordinates of the rect element
        and uses them to build a 'shadow' rectangle under the existing one. Finally, the 'shadow'
        rectangle is created using the SVGSVGElement's createSVGRect method.

        The 'SVGSVGElement' interface allows for creation of references to various primitive SVG interface types with explicitly defined default values.
      
      
        A reference to an 'SVGSVGElement' is obtained through an 'svg' element in the page's markup. Each of the 'CreateSVG*' methods is called from this 
        reference and initial values are verified. A counter is used to determine whether all conditions are satisfied. The word 'fail' in red via an SVG 
        'text' element is used to indicate failure and the word 'pass' in black is used to indicate passing.

        This tests that XML Namespaces are correctly implemented, in that the tuple
        of local name and namespace URI, rather than the prefix, is important.
      
      
        The first subtest is a
        group where the namespace prefix s is bound to the SVG namespace and an s:circle is drawn
        in pale yellow. The same group declares the default namespace to be a non-SVG namespace; the
        blue circle element in that namespace must not be drawn.
      
      
        The second subtest puts the namespace declarations on the elements themselves.  The
        prefix toto is bound to the SVG namespace and the XLink namespace is made the default namespace.
        Thus, the blue &lt;toto:a href="uri"&gt;Valid&lt;/toto:a&gt; is a valid link and must be traversable. Select this link,
        then go back to the test.
      
      
        The third subtest has no prefix on the element name 'a' and uses the usual xlink: prefix on the href
        attribute. However, both the default namespace and the namespace bound to the xlink prefix are
        dummy namespaces. Not only should the link not be traversable, it must not even display at all.
        If the text 'Invalid' is displayed, the test fails.

         stroke (black 1-pixel lines), font-family and font-size properties.
        
        
          There are 4 svg elements in the test.
          The first defines the outer square at 480x360.
          The second whose id is lowerRight defines a green rectangle which is 1/4 of the outer svg element.
          The third svg whose id is upperLeft defines a region that is the upper 1/4 of the outer svg,
          it is filled with a blue rectangle.  It has a child svg element that defines an area
          half again the size of its parent but sharing the same center point, it is filled with a yellow rectangle.

        The purpose of the symbol test case is to create some symbols and then

        This file contains 3 symbol definitions.  Only two are ever rendered.
        There is a viewport defined to be 0,0,1000,1000 on the svg element.
        Each symbol has is own viewport of the same dimensions.  The symbols are
        scaled when they are instantiated by the use element,  The first set
        of symbols is 4 squares, blue and yellow in color they should appear
        in the lower right of the view arranged in a checkerboard fashion.
        The second symbol to be used is an image which should appear in the
        upper left of the view area.  The symbol that is not used and should
        not be rendered is a large black rectangle.  If the symbols don't
        appear, there is something askew with the use statement, if they
        appear but either overlap each other or in some way aren't in the
        correct positions they have not honored either their viewport or
        were not scaled when placed by the use element in the area defined by
        it.  If everything is black then perhaps a symbol was rendered that
        should not have been.

        This test verifies visual synchronization during run time between 'use' instances and the elements they reference. A 'g' element containing
        two 'rect' elements is referenced via 'use'. One 'rect' is red and the other has no fill specified. DOM synchronization is verified visually
        by removing the red 'rect'. Presentation attribute synchronization is verified visually by setting the other rect's 'fill' attribute to 'lime'.
        The 'g' that is referenced is inside of a 'defs' tag so only the 'use' instance is visible.

        The test defines a 'use' element with its 'xlink:href' attribute set to 'pass' which is an invalid element id. A green 'rect' element has its 'id'
        attribute set to 'pass' via 'setAttribute'. The referenced 'rect' is a child of a 'defs' element so that it does not render, and it is wrapped with a 'g'
        element in order to obtain a DOM reference to it.

        This tests that SVGTextContentElement.getSubStringLength()
        handles out-of-range charnum and nchars parameter values correctly.
      
      
        The test consists of 5 sub-tests, which test the different
        combinations of values passed to SVGTextContentElement.getSubStringLength().
        The result of each sub-test is shown as a small rectangle: black
        indicates that the sub-test did not run, red indicates that
        the sub-test failed and green indicates that the sub-test
        succeeded.

        This tests that methods on the SVGTextContentElement interface
        that take an index to a character or a number of characters
        actually interpret these as indexes to or numbers of UTF-16 code
        units. To test this, a character from outside the Basic Multilingual Plane 
        (U+10000; LINEAR B SYLLABLE B008) is used in a text string. 
        This character is stored in UTF-16 as a surrogate pair.

          Purpose of test is to determine if the font family is being
          correctly selected. The top two lines of text test serif fonts;
          the top line in maroon tests the generic font family 'serif'
          and the second line in black tests a selection of commonly
          available named serif fonts. The next two lines of text test
          sans-serif fonts;
          the top line in maroon tests the generic font family 'sans-serif'
          and the second line in black tests a selection of commonly
          available named sans serif fonts. The following two lines
          of text test monospaced fonts;
          the top line in maroon tests the generic font family 'monospaced'
          and the second line in black tests a selection of commonly
          available named monospaced fonts. The lowercase 'i' and uppercase'W'
          should be the same width,for monospaced fonts.
        
        
          The seventh line of text, in green, tests for
          three non-existent fonts (nonsense names). There is no fallback
          generic font specified. The text must be displayed anyway.

        Purpose of test is to determine if the font weight is being
        correctly rendered. A number of font families are specified. The
        numerical weight values (100 to 900) should show the lighter weights
        on the lower numbers and the heavier weights on the larger numbers.
        Heavier is defined to mean 'no lighter'.
      
      
        If only one font weight is available, they should all display at the
        same weight. The transition from black to green figures shows the
        correct light to bold transition for the common case where two
        weights are available. If three or more weights are available, see
        the CSS2 specification for how these are allocated to the nine
        weight numbers.
      
      
        The absolute keywords 'normal' and bold' are tested
        by the first two lines on the right hand side of the test,

        and 'lengthAdjust' attributes.
      
      
        There are four pairs of sub-tests.  Each pair of sub-tests consists
        of the same two strings:  "Line to Stretch" on the left, and "this is
        a line to squeeze" on the right.
      
      
        The first (topmost) pair contains no occurrences of the textLength and
        lengthAdjust attributes in the 'text' elements.
        The pink reference line under each of the top
        two strings indicates the approximate length of the strings.  Since
        the lengths are not constrained by the 'textLength' attribute, small
        variations of the lengths are permissible.
      
      
        The remaining three pairs each applies 'textLength' attributes to the
        strings.  In the leftmost sub-test of each pair, the 'textLength' value
        will cause a stretching of the string of approximately 25% over the
        "normal" length.  In the rightmost sub-test of each pair, the 'textLength' value
        will cause a squeezing of the string of approximately 20% under the
        "normal" length for the string.
      
      
        In each of the sub-tests with an application of 'textLength', the
        pink reference lines indicate the exact extent of the rendered text.
        The rendered text should fit snugly just within the ticks at the end of
        the pink lines.
      
      
        The second pair from the top contains 'textLength' but no 'lengthAdjust'
        attributes.  In this case, the effect should be as if the value "spacing"
        were specified.  Only the inter-character advancement and inter-word spacing
        should change.  The aspect ratio of the glyphs should be unaffected.  The
        reference image illustrates one valid way to achieve this, by a
        uniform increase or decrease of inter-character advancement.
      
      
        The third pair from the top explicitly sets 'lengthAdjust' value
        to "spacing".  Therefore it should be rendered identically to the second pair.
      
      
        The fourth (bottommost) sub-test pair explicitly sets 'lengthAdjust' value
        to "spacingAndGlyphs".  The advancements between characters and words, as well as
        the glyph aspect ratios should be affected.
        The reference image illustrates one valid way to achieve
        this, by a uniform expansion or compression of the string as a whole.
        This effect is equivalent to application of a "scale(xfactor, 1.0)" transformation
        to the 'text' elements.

          The purpose of this test is to validate proper handling of
          the text element's x and y attributes.
          In the various samples, a orange marker shows the text's (0,0)
          coordinate. The blue markers show the current text positions.
          These are either defined by absolute x/y positioning or they
          are computed from the embeded font's glyphs advances.
        
        
          The first text sample shows a reference piece of text.
        
        
          The second text sample (x all) shows a piece of text where
          all the glyphs are positioned along the x axis.
        
        
          The third text sample (x more) is a text element where there
          are more x values than characters (5 values for 4 characters).
          The last x value should be ignored and the result should
          be the same as the third sample.
        
        
          The fourth text sample (x fewer) is a text element where there
          are fewer x values than characters (3 values for 4 characters).
          The last character should not be positioned but laid out normally,
          following its previous character sibling.
        
        
          The fifth (y all), sixth (y more) and seventh (y fewer) text sample
          parallel the second,
          third and fourth test, but for the y attribute values.
        
        
          The samples in the right column show combinations of x/y
          value sets.

          The first line shows an example where there is a ligature (fi) which
          should be accounted for before breaking into text chunks (see specification
          section 10.5, additional x/y/dx/dy processing rules, bullet discussing
          ligatures). In this first line, the ligatures cause the x position 180
          (shown in orange), to be ignored. As a result, a glyph should be shown over
          each pale blue square markers. The glyphs are black squares of increasing sizes
          except for the initial ligature which has the form of two small black triangles
          joined at their tops. The ligature should show on the first pale blue
          marker position.
        
        
          The second line shows the same test but using multiple y positions.

        This tests parts of the SVGStringList interface. Particularly it tests that
        strings that are taken from one SVGStringList and then inserted into another
        SVGStringList duplicates the value instead of removing the value from the
        first list when it's inserted into the second list.

          This tests that the contents of an animVal object are read only.
          This is tested for interfaces SVGAnimatedNumberList, SVGAnimatedLength,
          SVGAnimatedLengthList, SVGAnimatedAngle, SVGAnimatedRect,
          SVGAnimatedTransformList and SVGAnimatedPreserveAspectRatio.
